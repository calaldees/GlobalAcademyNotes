> Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye

### Videos
> NOTE: All videos use LOSSY `mpeg` codecs that loose colour information and creating `ghosting` of colour bleed to the other eye. This reduces the quality of the 3D effect for videos. Static `png` images are lossless and therefore unaffected by this problem.
