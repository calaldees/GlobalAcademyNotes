You help 30 young people?
What about 100? 1000?

Copying *is* a part of learning. Reference sources.
Assessment is exam based

Benefits
* As a teacher
    * See timestamped progress
    * Reproduce issue + Offer support as merge request
    * Run automated tests
* As a student
    * Roll back to working versions
    * Experience with professional tools
    * No excuses for loosing work


Techniques
* Code review
* Pair programming (2 keyboards in one machine)
* Setup a Discord/Slack server
    * #code #cooltech #random
    * 6th formers moderate?
* Links to calendar entries (for deadlines)


case studies
Karakara - free - austraila adds new features
SuperLimitBreak tech stack - free + documented - even is someone copies us - they wont have the ideas

Fab** - testers should not look at code
