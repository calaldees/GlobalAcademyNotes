Spotting Abuse
--------------

Our current Secondary Education system means it's difficult to get a holistic picture of a students overall experience.

Do not shy away from your responsibility's because you think "I'm not really trained in that".
You interact with 1000's of young people all day every day for your entire professional career.
You know what is abnormal.
You know when a students behaviour changes over short and long term.
Your duty of care extends beyond your subject knowledge.

Don't ignore warning signs - you are a professional.

Sometimes Parents do not want to acknowledge or know how to cope with a problem.

But how do you have the conversation with young people?
You are not supposed to talk about personal circumstances.

If they talk to you, before they divulge any personal information you must be very clear that you will talk to other staff if you think it is necessary.
You are never to be confided in and keep secrets. You must be transparent and unified with senior staff.
This is to protect yourself.


Workplace Etiquette
-------------------

### Courageous Leadership

You have a duty of care over your students.
I would like to extend that to.
You have a duty of care over your team (this includes your colleges).
Your have some element of control over your teams emotional state.

> Let's all choose to be the leaders we wish we had

I don't agree with the bluntness of his ethos, but I do resonate with the concept of 'you actions being a powerful agent for change'

* Conduct yourself properly
    * Who would you trust
        * Heart surgeon flapping arms around and shouting 'oh no there is blood everywhere'
        * Heart surgeon calming explaining the breach and asking for the next tool
* Use Precise Language
* Identify problems - Collate solutions - Take action points
    * Prevent cyclic patterns - call them out
* Identify the *spirit* of conversations
    * Students are not _retards_
* Toxic colleges
    * Call out negative comments
    * Identify/Validate the underlying emotion they are displaying
    * Be a role model for them

### Escalating

When talking doesn't work; know what the next step could be.

Mentioning of Students
----------------------

Your advice should be
* Free from judgement
* Not in allegiance with a political sphere
* Highlight areas of concern without them being instructions (young people hate instructions)

You are a role model - if you want them to be passionate and curious - you have to be passionate and curious


Careers Advice to Students
--------------------------

As professionals we are (part of) laying the foundations for the rest of their lives.
As a professional we are guiding young people to be confident, competent, stable, communities.

The idealistic "follow your dreams" is selfish/elitist and only half the story.
The full quote should read "Support your community, to facilitate following your dreams".

> Satisfaction comes from *experience* not _passion_

> Ask not what your country can do for you â€” ask what you can do for your country

[Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy)

I don't like the term _country_ - so I suggest a replacement of _community_

There are plenty of roles that society needs.
Why would you deliberately ignore what society needs to live your life in your own self indulgent bubble?
Many students cite: Singer, Game Designer, Actor, Film Director, YouTuber, Steamer, Footballer as desired occupations. Because that is the only world they know.
This narrow view is understandable; it's ultimately the failing of adults ability to convey the concept of society to young people.
We need to stop indulging our young people. We risk creating a generation of self-obsessed, wingey, skill-less turnips.

Skill up to assist your community.
Get revenue for it.
Get satisfaction from it.
Use the extra financial capability to fund what you want to do. Be it travelling, starting a family, facilitating your own creative projects or adventures.
If they don't get a career and contribute back to society they are going to have problems.
