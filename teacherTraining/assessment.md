Assessment
==========

Objective:
* Understand the required formal assessment methods in schools
* Understand the need/techniques for Summative and Formative assessment
* Appreciate the difference between the visible and invisible curriculum

This session fundamentally describes the entire profession.
This is the single most important session in the entire year.

We must deeply internalise and understand the extremes.
We NEED assessment and we NEED humanisation.
We are going to journey through a range of emotions.


Visible Curriculum
------------------

Why are you here?
[Teacher Standards](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665522/Teachers_standard_information.pdf)

* Help mould young people to be lifelong learners, passionate, self worth, collaborative, community driven human beings

* Can't rely on teachers opinion - no standardisation
* Baseline for comparison across departments/schools/county's
* Evidence based rather than opinion based

* You observe the students - you already know - you know them - you work with 1000's of kids with years of experience. You know. But you need evidence.

* IQ of 86 - Minimum bar for military
    * Under this number there is not a single task that can be given to the individual that is not counter productive.
    * 10% of the population

* Governments 'Value added': +/- from predicted attainment
    * Take Sats (english/maths) estimate IQ
    * Take entire country's GCSE results.
    * Derive average expected GCSE attainment (year 11) from sats (year 7)
    * Apply this derived heuristic to next years cohort (or loosely any future cohort at any yeargroup stage)
* All teachers/departments are ranked in every school.
    * Whether you're told or not; you are ranked.
    * Take a single student
    * Average all their other GCSE's
    * Compare their GCSE average against your subjects attainment +/-
    * Sort the list

* When dealing with averages on this scale, no excuse matters
    * One student had XYZ so they attained poorly. Well averages state another student did better than expected. The world is even. The exucse that a whole class is 'rotten' doesn't hold up against the averages. The weak link is you.

* Schools want this standardised assessment
* Parents want this standardised assessment
* Govenments want this standardised assessment

* Teachers in different schools suffer different burdens
    * Ghrama school teachers stating their two level 4's are shameful (one was a school refuser, one had learning difficulty's. The result is still abounding!)
    * Comprehensive school teachers would be overjoyed at 38% of a class attaining level 4

* Cambels law - Any system with a measurable metric is gamed.
* Anything that you do that is not directly related to GCSE metrics (or Open Evening Preception) is pointless.
* SMT Don't know or care.
* If you're _nice_ but don't produce results you'll be seen as a weak practitioner.

* Cash cash cash
    * A-Level class
    * 16 students
    * All predicted E's (because you cant be preicted U's because there is no point in sitting the course)
        * Most students only got 4 GCSE's (in ICT that was 100% coursework), so they take ICT A-Level or Computing A-Level as it' the only foundation skill on paper they have competence in.
    * If they are all predicted U's is this the best choice for this student?
    * Who care's if it's good for the student; every bum on a seat is raw cash baby!!!

* Education is a business.
* Welcome to the factory.

Every Teacher knows the system is not sufficient - let's not re-enforce that - let's find solutions


Invisible Curriculum - Character Traits
---------------------------------------

* Draw a picture of a horse as accuratly as possible - you will be marked on proportions, feature accuracy, detail - show publicly (5 min)
* Outside (change lesson)
* Write a 3 line poem about Computing. You have (5 min)

Imagine being placed under somebody else's control every 60 minuets and asked to do something that you can't do and then display it publicly and constantly compare you to your peers.

Activity: Why are you here? (Refer to the teacher standards)

* "Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live the rest of it's whole life thinking it's stupid" (Albert Einstein)
* "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self" (Anthony Moore)
* Ken Robinson's Story - Mary - Year 3 - Cold breaktime - drawing God - 'nobody knows what god looks like' - 'they will in a minuet miss' - then the lesson starts, robbed of that freedom.

* The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is ok as far as it goes
* The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading.
* The third step is to presume that what cant be measured easily really isn't very important. This is blindness.
* The forth step is to say that that which can't be easily measured really doesn't exist
(Blatchford 2014)

Activity: Discuss:Some schools ask for an attainment and effort grade? what do you think??

* Brockman story
* Charles Tom story

Activity: Board: What are the character traits we want to inspire? Invisible Curriculum (Refer to the Teacher Standards for inspiration).


### Assessing Character Traits and Attitudes (Andrew Hammond)

The 'language' of character

Terms that are rubbish
* soft skills
* progress (end in mind)
* potential (fixed)
* performance (refers to measuring)


'development' implies growth

* Grit
    * gritty, tenacious, committed, courageous, plucky, resolute
* Adaptability
    * adaptable, flexible, accommodating, open, tolerant
* Optimism
    * Optimistic, resilient, positive, confident, enthusiastic, hopeful
* Self-Control
    * Composed, graceful, poised, reserved, in-control, self-directed, self-regulatory
* Empathy
    * Empathic, understanding, considerate, compassionate, kind
* Discernment
    * Discerning, reasoned, rational, responsible, shrewd, astute, grounded, balanced
* Trust
    * collaborative, cooperative, team-player, trusting, participative

'Observable evidence' (not assessment)

Teacher as a model learner
* '6th form complaints about other teacher' story


The Rules?

| Have Courage       | Help others to be strong          |
| Stay positive      | look for the good in others       |
| Show self-control  | Work together as a team           |
| Embrace change     | Help those who find change hard   |
| Believe in yourself | Believe in others                  |
| Respect yourself   | Show respect to others            |
| Do what is right   | Help others to do the right thing |

* If there is a mark in a spreadsheet, markbook, notebook it suddenly has professional weight/value. The knowledge in your head carrys less weight.
* so record it


Learning is something the learners have to do for themselves
Failed a test: Not because you didn't prepare well, it's because your stupid.


Summative/Formative Assessment
------------------------------

* Summative
    * focus is on the outcome
    * gcse result, grade, number
    * no meaningful feedback
* Formative
    * facilitates the participants development
    * suggestions for improvement, questioning, verbal feedback, self evaluation, peer assessment

Ofstead want
* What grade/level are you currently at
* What is there next step. How to improve
    * Target setting is a formalised for of feedback - specific and challenging
    * Short term and long term goals are required to make progress

ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupilsâ€™ understanding and needs
6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleadingfactors, such as how busy pupils appear.

### Formative

Formative assessment is more effective steaming/setting
[Inside the Black Box](https://www.rdc.udel.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/InsideBlackBox.pdf) (Black and William, 1998)

Ruth Butler 1987
* mark only
* comment only (30% improvement)
* mark and comment

[AfL Tools](https://www.slideshare.net/caldiesschool/tl-assessment-for-learning-tools)

https://mikegershon.com/resources/

ITT Core Framework
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


#### Assessment Criteria -> Peer/Self Assessment

Activity: "Pupils a can identify a range of web page design features and can explain why the designer has chosen to use them for the target audience"

Publish your assessment criteria
Show examples of good/bad work
They now know + can peer self assess

You see 300+ students a week - you dont have a chance of marking it

Advantages of peer assessment
* stepping stone for self assessment
* less threatening than teacher
* more honest (brutal)
* language more relateable
* more likely to interrupt rather than continue listening to teacher
* different approach angle than teacher


#### Questioning Techniques

Questioning is a form of assessment.

hands up
targeted
pair share
  snowball
round robin
expert groups
Jigsaw (different groups, different questions)
individual whiteboards
Opinion line

Questioning 1-2-1 to assess understanding


Tracking
--------

[OCR Assessment Resources](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse/computer-science-j276-from-2016/assessment/)
OCR Project tracking sheet

* Transparency - Available to everyone? - Data protection
* See who's falling behind
* Setting targets
* Tracking should be available to you, students, department - How?

* Students should have a habit of evidence gathering - the process is more important than the outcome

* Dictaphone? - how to archive/store? catalog? transcribe?

Activity:
* What data will you track for a class?
* How often?
* How will this data help
    * you? (accountability)
    * students?
    * department?
* How will you track it?
    * Spreadsheet
    * SIM's Software (ubertrack for smt impractical for everyday use)

Lambert and Lines (2000) describe how teachers fall into an 'Accountability Trap' where they see there own tracking systems as being used to 'prove' their competence.


### 'Cover your ass' case study

* Every practical focused A-Level lesson. Sat one-to-one with student. These are the deadlines you've missed. These are the attainments of your current work. Conversation recorded in database. Key points for improvement. New dealines for missing work. weekley log of everything agreeed with student. They know they have work that is 3 weeks late a letter will be sent home.
* Near end of year a student realised they were really really really behind. Made a sob story about how they were not supported properly and it was the school/teachers fault. Parent goes on warpath. Calls meeting with Head of 6th form and Head of Department and Teacher. Parent ready for a fight. Teacher puts down 5 sheets of A4 with every conversation with the student over the year documented. Multiple letters sent home that 'never got there'. Student frog marched out of room.
* NO Student. However good your rapport with, is your friend. They will turn on you. Your department will turn on you. The only defence you will ever have is assessment evidence and records. They are your lifeline. Never EVER keep poor records.


### Software Concept

* My tracker idea
* Is there such a thing?
* AI voice recognition cloud service (Global Radio hack - 'freq')

You wanted more control ... now you've got it!
How do we know we're marking consistently with other practitioners?

* primary to secondary?
* change schools?
* compare schools?
* compare teachers?

moderation across department, schools
Do this sooner rather than later

Becoming a standard
[CAS Progression Pathways](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/quick_start_secondary/progression_path.pdf)
are all strands equal? overall grade? 7 in noe and 4 in another
how dose this level help the student?

### Entry Level Qualifications

[OCR Entry Level](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/entry-level/computer-science-r354-from-2016/)
* 100% center assessed + externally moderated
* Good progression for GCSE

Good Kids in Poor schools
-------------------------

Are not harmed.
Makes me consider the reality of how much impact schools actually have.
The most important thing is 'igniting the spark of passion' in young people. The _system_ is not the reason we exist.
