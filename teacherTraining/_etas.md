ETAS
====

The assessment for this module will take the form of a teaching portfolio.
The portfolio will be made up of 4 sections on the following topics:


1. The use of learning technology
2. Assessment and feedback practice
3. Other 
    * (participant’s choice of focus e.g. students as partners in learning, reflective practice in the classroom, use of Academic Peer Mentors etc.)
(All three sections will add up to a total of 2000 words or each of the three parts equivalent in total e.g. 4 minutes of an alternative such as video or voiced PowerPoint - X 3 would be a total of 12-13 minutes)

4. A reflection on an authentic practice observation and feedback activity
(2000 words or equivalent - e.g. 12-13 minutes voiced PowerPoint recording, video with annotations)

Two things to keep at the front of your mind are REFLECT CONSTANTLY and EVALUATE YOUR OWN PRACTICE - so everything you do is about recognising, developing and enhancing your practice and linking it to the activities and research that you do for this module. This does need to be linked to research in the field so try to draw links between what yo read and what you do.
