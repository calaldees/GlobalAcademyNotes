* Why am I here? ... To Help you
* Your trying to survive. I have a job to teach the others.
* What are we going to do about this moving forward? Agree together. They can't discuss back because they lack the skillset.
* Rules are a blunt tool: They can be broken when they are understood, but most people don't have the background, info, time, analysis
