Behaviour
=========


    * How can we aid _Behaviour for Learning_ through our planning and teaching in Computing?
    * Barriers to learning Computing
        * Technical (reliable?, responsive?)
        * Mental/Emotional (99% of the time software is broken)
    * Verbal and non-verbal communication for behaviour
    * The physical space of a Computer room
    * Laws relating to computer use and how this can be incorporated into classroom practice
    * Teacher as a role model
        * self-regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives
    * Pupils worldview and motivation
        * Intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values)
        * Considering 'Meaningful success' from pupils perspective
        * pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood
    * Predictable and secure environment
        * reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement


Pre-Reading

* Task (30min)
    * Generate a list of hypothetical possible misbehaviours (You will add to this list throughout the session)
        * Consider categorise your items in some way
        * Consider behaviour that might be specific to a computer-room or online
    * Generate a list of positive/expected behaviours you want to see in your lessons (You will add to this list throughout the session)
    * Consider possible short term and long term solutions for both misbehaviours and positive behaviours (You will add to this list throughout the session)

UPCOMING TASK: In groups of 3. You will be given a session-task to list one of your misbehaviours and invite other members of the group to suggest courses of action. 
This will be towards the end of the session. The session content will augment your possible responses.


Session Overview
----------------

* 1 Hour: Theory
* 30min: My real case study examples
* 1 Hour: Discussion Consolidation

The first skill student teachers develop is behaviour management.

Recurring dream - students out of control - every night - never dreamed again (maybe once every 6 months I can remember fragments?)


Proactive not reactive

* [DfE Behaviour and discipline in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools)  January 2016
    * Teachers have a power to impose detention outside school hours
    * Teachers can confiscate pupils’ property
    * Parental consent is not required for detentions

Is the curriculum accessible?
If child feeled thretened they will not be able to alyse/judge properly

# Benefits of good behaviour

* Stress lower (for everyone)
* Better use of time
* Higher attainment

# Bad behaviour

* Late
* Missing Equipment
* Distracting Other Students
* Interrupting teacher
* Attention Seeking (taking time from teacher unnecessarily)

What is this behaviour
What does this mean
What strategy should I use

Teach Behaviour (like literacy strategy)
* Objective, "build collaboration skills by"
    * Resourcefulness, Resilience, Perseverance
    * Ignoring distractions
    * Sharing equipment
    * Listen to others
    * Mindful of other time and emotional state (Empathy)

Is this lesson worth behaving in?

* Self (Engagement) [Emotional]
    * Confidence
    * Try new things
    * 99% of Computing is failure
* Subject (Access) [Cognitive]
    * wants to do it, knows how to do it, can do it
    * Interested
    * Motivated
    * Skills
* Teacher
    * Respectful
* Peers (Participation) [Social]
    * Communicate
    * Volunteer info
    * Wait to speak
    * Does not annoy others, keeps on task


* Teaching learning behaviours will reduce the need to manage misbehaviour
* Teachers should encourage pupils to be self-reflective of their own behaviours

Consistency and Policy
----------------------

Dont let your colleges down

School leaders should ensure the school behaviour policy is clear and consistently applied


Support
-------

High behaviour needs



Positive re-enforcement
-----------------------

Like the sides of a water-slide - you need both rewards and sanctions as tools.

The difference between
* Positive correction
* Positive reinforcement

### Culture

I sometimes joke that teachers have the role of a _Cult Leader_.

You are the leader of a cult
Kind of an odd analogy, but an idea for a mindset. You create the rules, values, indoctrinate
* Unconsciously, we try to fit in, to conform. We often try to behave normally (for that culture)
* Normative messages
* Routines

### Intrusive?

* Public vs Private praise
    * Some children would be character assassinated if they had rapport with a teacher. Be mindful.
* Non verbal
    * (smile, thumbs up, nod)
    * pause, eye contact, shake head
    * gesture (4 legs on the floor)
* How Intrusive is your intervention

### Praise

If you just focus on the negative/sanctions, that is only half of the story.

* Rewards should be consistent (just like sanctions should be consistent)
    * If the disruptive child sits still for 10min. That is not an opportunity for praise, that is expected.
* Leaders should identify % of sanctions vs rewards. Teachers should be consistent across the school.
* Hollow praise should be avoided
    * Praise should be specific given with reasons

### The Entrance

The psychology of owning the physical space.

[Teacher Has Incredible Handshakes With Each Student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctaUNJpT6U)

* Line up
    * No one enters your space
* Happy greet chat banter as they line up
* Tidy uniform - respect for themselfs and the space they are about to enter
* Calm (not shouting)
* Enter calmly and orderly
    * Send some out if needed
* Routeen to start starter task
    * Start On board? 
    * Starter on paper?
    * Logon + Load up IDE?
* Do not be afraid to repeat whole class procedures if the class don't settle
    * If the class get too unfocused and you can't get their focus back - take the whole class outside to lineup again

In the event that the class are already in the classroom (+settled) when you arrive. Assert dominance over the space
* If the lights are off turn them on (or off)
* Open the windows
* Move a desk/chair


### Tips

* Doorway visibility trick
    * (have sanctioned student out of sight)
* Keyboards up, Screens off
    * Humans are like moths to a light-bulb - they CANNOT not use them
    * Get RAZOR good at detecting a single mouse/keyboard click and stop immediately
        * (as you get more experienced you have more cognitive capacity to do this)
* Routine for transitions
    * Timer on board? Countdown(like tv show)? Bell? Keyboards up? Screens off?

### Room layout

* Room layout: See as many screens as possible
    * 2 walkways == 75% visual coverage (50% alternating)
    * U shape == 100% coverage (not space efficient)
    * Rows == (bugger), clear screen off routines
* Teacher remote control? (I'm not sure of it's value)


Sanctions (Negative enforcement)
--------------------------------

Snactions part 22

### Good sanctions are

* clear (unambiguous)
* concrete (give examples)
* sequential (do x, then y, n then z)
* consistent/fair
* timely

Practical application
* Language of choice/ownership
    * By continuing to X you are _choosing to_ Y
* Allow takeup time
* Ignore secondary behaviours (but follow it up)
    * e.g. huffing and sighing, slamming a door, rolling of eyes, repeating/delaying with questions


### Detention

Should be productive and have a purpose.

[Ms McInerney’s “Book of Consequences” Detention System](https://lauramcinerney.com/ms-mcinerneys-book-of-consequences-detention-system/)
> They WILL happen - mean what you say
> the initial question on the sheet asked pupils to write why they were in detention. I reckon about 60% of kids said something different to the reason why I had put them on detention. Sometimes they even admitted things I hadn’t seen
> students lied a lot less about what had happened because their words were being put down on paper. 
> I always make pupils sign their papers and agree to what their future solution will be. Being able to get out those papers if there is ever another detention is VERY helpful for parent’s evening

Concept?
* Once they understand the reason they are there and have a resolution
* Make them fun - build rapport - show them something amazing about computing
    * The punishment is that you're directing their time.

Question: Should a detention ever be fun? Why? Why Not?


### Identifying Behaviour Incentives


* Always look for the _incentive_ for behaviour.
    * What is the incentive to behave, what is the incentive not to behave?
* They adhere to their social _role_/_status_

> The benefits (like looking good among peers) outweigh the costs (looking bad to teachers/parents).
> It’s worth recalling Graham Nuthall’s conclusion: 
> "When there is a clash between the peer culture and the teacher’s management procedures, the peer culture wins every time (2007, p.37)."

* Some behaviour is calculated
    * > (1) the benefit that one stands to gain from the crime; 
      > (2) the probability of getting caught; and 
      > (3) the expected punishment if one is caught. 
      > By comparing the first component (the gain) with the last two components (the costs) , the rational human being can determine whether a particular crime is worth it or not.
        * (Ariely, 2013, p.14)
* Some behaviour is habitual
    * No calculated choice. Just adolescent self centred autopilot.
    * It's not deliberate _evil_ it's just lack of social skills and socialisation
    * You can impact this!


### Resolutions - Discussions with students

* Resolution: Explain Why (meta behaviour)
    * The number 1 factor for success/happiness == socialisation. This is more important than ANY subject knowledge/skill
* Separate Person from Behaviour
    * I want you in my classroom, but that behaviour should stay outside


#### Students feel
* Teachers are evil (they all self centred. none of them understand or care about me)
* I'm not academic (even if I try it's pointless)
* This is a waste of my time (it's not relevant to me)
* School is shit (there is nothing good here other than my friends)

#### The conversation
* Tone of conversation 
    * It's not an attack. It's a adult to adult conversation
    * (subtext: you are reassuring them they are safe)
* Why am I (the teacher) here? ... I'm here help you ... I'm not your enemy
* You're trying to get through your own stuff. I have a job to teach the others.
* What are we going to do so that we can both have a better experience moving forward? 
    * Agree together. 
    * Young people can't really have this as a two way discussion as they lack the skillset analysis and experience. You can fill that in. make suggestions. Agree together.

Bruce Perry 3R's - Adults help to regulate behavioural thinking in adolescents



Strategies
-----------

### Weak strategies

* Bribes (sweets, or leave early)
    * They take away from the focus being learning
* Anger, rage, loss of control
    * Will result in lack of respect
    * This is not the same as stern discontent or frustration


### Emotional conveyance as a tool
Elaboration on emotion and anger - Sometimes children cannot identify with the severity if the wide _pallet of emotion_ is not used.
I've tried to explain to groups of children. Sometimes they just don't understand. My words alone lack impact.
I have to perform the pantomime of emotion to convey the message to the target audience.
I'm not angry at them. I don't hate them. They are normal children. But I have to pretend to escalate my emotional state to communicate the intention effectively.


### Computing Specific disruptions

* Bolt the computers down
* Broken computers are _clearly_ marked.
    * If not marked students will try to _fix_ them, and cause more problems!
        * Broken ports!
        * Unplugging mice from other machines to sit next-to their friends
    * Plan for broken computers in your seating plan
* Constant distraction to all students at all time
    * Keyboards up (visual scan)
    * Turn screens off?
* Hacking; key loggers
* Lost files, didn't save, cant find it
* Non verbal student communication (e.g. typing and looking at each other screens)
* Water (kryptonite to computers)
* Off task (so many distracting things)
* TVBeGone
* Computer Misuse (interrupting another program)
* Use of facility's for other subjects (Your room could become disrupted/damaged/used)
* [Accessibility Shortcuts](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/deafplus/windows-accessibility-shortcuts) and [StickyKeys](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-sticky-keys-windows-10) - Know how to identify them
    * This can disrupt lesson by a confused student
        * Beeps on every keypress
        * Invert screen
        * Change language


Stories
-------

My stories from teaching

* The Angry kid (stomping in)
* The class that would not settle (fire extinguish)
* The plum to the back of the head - and the outcome
* Ice cream at the side of the bus
* Gifts (hiding game)
* The weird kid
* Year 11 P5 Friday - Remove the class
* Image manipulation lesson - monster - detention - revoked
* My teacher deleted my work - He hates me
* Hypothetical - Teeth are flying - advice? walk away

Perceptions from an experienced teacher
---------------------------------------

Seen it all before. The same patterns repeating over and over and over.
You see a student chimping about and you just get board. You will have to go through hours of re-enforcement, hours of the same conversations that you've had year after year. Sometimes it will have an impact sometimes it wont. After a year of hard graft, all the progress is lost as you get another untrained army of chimps.
