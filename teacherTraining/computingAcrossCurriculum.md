Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support our fellow teaching colleges with our Computing skills


Ofsted and Computing

* [Ofsted Assessing Computing](https://www.softegg.co.uk/blog/ofsted-inspecting-the-computing-curriculum)
* [Ofsted inspections: myths](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015/ofsted-inspections-mythbusting)
* [Computing Across the Curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBgaR8sNcE) - [Myles Berry](http://milesberry.net/about-3) - CAS TV - June 2016
* [Computing in the curriculum: Challenges and strategies from a teacher's perspective](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-016-9482-0) - Sue Sentance - April 2016 - King’s College London UK

> A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world

> Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

* Ofsted say - Computing curriculum is good or better when
    * Context relevant to pupils lives and reflect increasing use of computing in the world of industry.
    * Links with wider community to provide enrichment activities
    * Links with other subjects in school are productive in strengthening pupils leaning in computing


Responsibility's of Computing Teachers
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * Computer science
    * Information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * Digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support
    * our schools with ICT and digital literacy
        * Very few other teachers will have a background in Computing
        * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in some aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
        * We should be consider this _support_ part of our role in schools
    * our subject with strong cross curricular
        * Literacy
            * [Ofsted Improving literacy in secondary schools: a shared responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-literacy-in-secondary-schools-a-shared-responsibility)
                > Our world is dominated by the written word, both online and in print. This means we can only contribute and participate actively if we can read and write sufficiently well.

                > where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects
            * Use precise language
                * Many young people cannot convey there ideas (verbally or written)
                * If you can't describe/distil your ideas - you cannot think
                * Subject vocabulary to describe complex problems efficiently
            * [The Secret of Literacy: Making the implicit, explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/)
