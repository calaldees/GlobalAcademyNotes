Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support teaching colleges with our Computing skills


Ofsted and Computing

* [Ofsted Assessing Computing](https://www.softegg.co.uk/blog/ofsted-inspecting-the-computing-curriculum)
* [Ofsted inspections: myths](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015/ofsted-inspections-mythbusting)
* [Computing Across the Curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBgaR8sNcE) - [Myles Berry](http://milesberry.net/about-3) - CAS TV - June 2016

> A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world

> Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

* Ofsted say - Computing curriculum is good or better when
    * Context relevant to pupils lives and reflect increasing use of computing in the world of inductry. Wider community to provide enrichment activities
    * Links with other subjects in school are productive in strengthening pupils leaning in computing


Responsibility's of Computing Teachers
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * computer science
    * information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support our schools with ICT and digital literacy
    * Very few teachers have this skill-set or experience
    * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in all aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
    * We should consider this part of our role in schools
