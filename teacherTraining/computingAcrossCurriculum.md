Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support our fellow teaching colleges with our Computing skills


Ofsted and Computing

* [Computing Across the Curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBgaR8sNcE) - [Myles Berry](http://milesberry.net/about-3) - CAS TV - June 2016

> A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world

> Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

* Ofsted say - Computing curriculum is good or better when
    * Context relevant to pupils lives and reflect increasing use of computing in the world of industry.
    * Links with wider community to provide enrichment activities
    * Links with other subjects in school are productive in strengthening pupils leaning in computing


Responsibility's of Computing Teachers
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * Computer science
    * Information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * Digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support
    * our schools with ICT and digital literacy
        * Very few other teachers will have a background in Computing
        * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in some aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
        * We should be consider this _support_ part of our role in schools
    * our subject with strong cross curricular
        * Literacy
            * [Ofsted Improving literacy in secondary schools: a shared responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-literacy-in-secondary-schools-a-shared-responsibility)
                > Our world is dominated by the written word, both online and in print. This means we can only contribute and participate actively if we can read and write sufficiently well.

                > where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects
            * Use precise language
                * Many young people cannot convey there ideas (verbally or written)
                * If you can't describe/distil your ideas - you cannot think
                * Subject vocabulary to describe complex problems efficiently

    if not depth:
        return
    start_pos = t.pos()
    start_heading = t.heading()
    for branch_number in range(branches):
        t.setheading(
            start_heading - (total_angle / 2)
            +
            (branch_number * total_angle / (branches-1))
        )
        t.forward(size)
        draw_tree_recursive(t, size=size * 0.6, branches=branches, total_angle=total_angle * 0.8, depth=depth-1)
