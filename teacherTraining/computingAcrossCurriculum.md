Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

* Understand the power of context based learning.
    * Computing relates to EVERYTHING!
* Consider how we can support colleges with our Computing skills

A high-quality computing eduation equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world
Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

Ofstead say - Computing curriculm is good or better when
Context relevent to pupils lives and reflect increasing use of computing in the world of inductry. Wider community to provide enrichment activities
Links with other sibjects in school are productive in strengthening pupils leaning in computing

All subjects - terminology for all subjects

Barefoot

Logic: predicting alaysing
Algorithus: making steps & rules
Decomposition: breaking down into parts
Patterns: spotting using similaritys
Abstraction: removing unessiscary detail
Evaluation: making judgememt

Tinkering: experimenting & playing
Creating: designing & making
Debugging: finding & fixing
Perservering: keeping going
Collaboration: working together

Paper plane - deomposition

science classification - binary tree

Blender - scripted 3d animation project
Conways life
Algorithmic art - recusion
Music demos - elevated - perlin noise
Use applications in differnt languages
Rasbery Pie weather station - tweet the weather
Graph drawing - pandas python - met office weaterh data
kinect + scratch
phse - no goverment cencorship - free speech
re - Turing test - what rights do they need?
History of comuting timeline


promotes spiritual, moal, cultural, mental and physical development of putpis

Other subjects want you to train them in all aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's rather than facilitating you
Indipendence from teachers
