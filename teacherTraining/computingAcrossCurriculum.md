Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support our fellow teaching colleges with our Computing skills

ITT Core Framework
8.3
> Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues

[Education inspection framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/education-inspection-framework?#guidance-for-education-providers)

[David Drown HMI](https://www.slideshare.net/Ofstednews/inspection-computing-and-e-safety-in-schools)

* Teaching in computing is good or better when:
    * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the ‘big picture’
    * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ active participation in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
* The computing curriculum is good or better when:
    * the contexts in which computing is taught are relevant to pupils’ lives and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
    * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the wider community to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
    * links with other subjects in the school are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
* Leadership of computing is good or better when
    * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
    * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
* Finally ...
    * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

> A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world

> Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.


Responsibility's of Computing Teachers
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * Computer science
    * Information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * Digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support
    * our schools with ICT and digital literacy
        * Very few other teachers will have a background in Computing
        * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in some aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
        * We should consider this _support_ part of our role in schools
    * our subject with strong cross curricular
        * Literacy
            * [Ofsted Improving literacy in secondary schools: a shared responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-literacy-in-secondary-schools-a-shared-responsibility)
                > Our world is dominated by the written word, both online and in print. This means we can only contribute and participate actively if we can read and write sufficiently well.

                > where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects
            * Use precise language
                * Many young people cannot convey there ideas (verbally or written)
                * If you can't describe/distil your ideas - you cannot think
                * Subject vocabulary to describe complex problems efficiently
            * [The Secret of Literacy: Making the implicit, explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/)
        * Mathematics
            * [Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics-Dr-Jeremy/dp/1727125452/)

* Your role
    * You *ARE* the evangelist/ambassador for Computing in your school. For staff and students alike
    * Your enthusiasm and knowledge should permeate the air and infect the people around you
    * You need to convey how Computing changes us and our world

The rest of this session will prompt you into thinking about computing in a wider context with examples. Prepare for a datablast!

[Senate Stock Watcher](https://senatestockwatcher.com/) US Senators invest in socks. Before CoVid 19 many senators sold stocks in travel/touisum and invested in medical supplies while telling the US population 'not to worry'. Senetors report their stocks with paper written notes. It takes multiple weeks to process them and they can be incorrect/misinterpreted as handwriting can be hard to read.
