Literacy, Numeracy and Citizenship
==================================

My background:
* Poor literacy, bad handwriting, bad spelling
* Mother beside herself with grief and tears; that her son would be unable to function in the world
* I got extra time in all my exams in school and University
* My PGCE (Different course back then) Failed my online literacy test multiple times
* In my NQT year I spelt _The Simpsons_ incorrectly and my bottom set year 7 laughed
* My handwriting today is difficult for even me to read back
* I played a group game over near year where I had to draw a 'Judge' and I thought it said 'Jungle' and I drew a 'Jungle' when everyone else drew a Judge.
* I don't in any way identify myself as dyslexic or dyspraxic. Labels are utterly irrelevant.
* Yet in spite of that I am a successful working professional. Considered by peers exceptionally literate, informed and well read.


Literacy
--------

> Focussing on literacy objectives will not improve anything.
> Instead, what’s needed is for teachers to explicitly teach the language of their subject alongside their subject content.
> My slightly surprising insight is that if this is done well, the fact that children’s reading and writing improves is almost trivial.
> What really matters is that students get better at thinking.

[David Didau](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/what-to-do-about-literacy/) Author of _The Secret of Literacy_ making the implicit explicit

* We need literacy to in order to think
* Language shapes how we think
* To think like a computer scientist you have to talk like a computer scientist

What is the tipping point from _'just using words that scientists use'_ and _'talking like a scientist'_?

* Age 7 - top 25% have vocabulary of 7,100 words - bottom 25% 3,000 (parents?)
* Age 16 - 1 in 12 students has a working vocabulary of 800 words
* An average graduate has a vocabulary of 20,000 words

Matthew effect

#### Activity: Imagine
1min silence. Close your eyes. Imagine you lived in this world but were not literate. What things would it impair you doing?

Literacy is not a skill
It's the power to interact and understand the world

### The _Language_ of Computer Science

> Some words have specific meaning in the computer science community, but a slightly or sometimes completely different meaning in everyday discourse (e.g. nouns like code, memory, address, folder, loop, bug, value, or verb to save, to code, to retrieve, to submit)

Computer Science Education (2019)

> Metaphores: The data is transfered -> I will move the file to another folder
> Computer is a living being: it fell asleep and woke up
> Always be explicit - these are metaphors

Meta-Discourse
1. Clarify meaning in other non-cs contexts
2. Speculation about possible meanings (what it could or could not be)
3. Develop CS related meaning

Busch 1998

> I wrote a code
Professional developer interviewing for a position last week

> Unless we want to dumb down the curriculum to the point at which it's completely valueless, its impossible to penetrate the meaning of academic subjects using everyday language

(Original StarTrek episode 'Mirror,Mirror' http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/39.htm where parallel evil enterprise. The few proper crew on the evil enterprise blended in by acting like assholes. The evil crew on the good enterprise were immediately put in the brig.
KIRK: What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly?
SPOCK: It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men.
Without the language you can't mimic the use of the language
)

Examples of subject specific language:
* General langauge
    * I'll try -> I'll attempt
    * we'll talk -> we'll deliberate
    * he dosnt like me -> there is a failure of trust in this relationship
    * I can't do this -> I'm struggling with these concepts
* General concepts
    * Analysis, Evaluation, Decomposition
    * Mental model
    * Cognitive Bias, Cognitive load
    * "What was the composition of the team"
* Computing
    * Data Volumetrics, Permiations
    * Assignment, selection, iteration, set, dictionary, array, call stack depth, stack, queue, cache invalidation, proxy
    * Time Complexity, Parallelisation, Race hazard, Overload mathematical operators, Order of precedence, Wall Time
* Mathematics
    * Set comparison, Exponentially
* Biology
    * Cross contamination, Semi permeable membrane
* Teacher
    * Disaffected, target grade, value added, syllabus, curriculum, Threshold concept, senco, peer learning

Computer Science Prase Examples
* In terms of analyzing algorithms:
    * What is the performance of the algorithm (n, n2, nlogn etc...)
    * Are these temporary variables required in order to perform comparisons?
    * Does the algorithm fit the logic of the problem (i.e. if you're looking for largest prime numbers, do you need to loop through all numbers?)
    * Can you see any side effects caused by changing state within this method

#### Activity: Brainstorm
Given the examples above
1. Individually write on a piece of paper as many linguistic phrases or terminology Computing, scientific, linguistic or other domain specific language (5min)
2. Partner with another classmate and catagories/group your words in a rough venn/set diagram. Is there any overlap?

> On my first job as a designer, I had no idea what my boss was asking me to do. Online, I had learned about “paper prototypes” and “iterating on mockups.” But here he was telling me to “sketch a wire” and “riff on that comp.” I felt like he was speaking another language.

### What are schools expected to deliver?

(I always refer my students to the assessment criteria. You are teachers. I will refer you to your 'assessment criteria')

* [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
    > The EIF is built around the idea of the connectedness of curriculum
* [Improving_literacy_in_secondary_schools_-_report_summary](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413184/Improving_literacy_in_secondary_schools_-_report_summary.pdf)


#### Activity: Discuss
Given these examples above. What strategies could we use to enforce literacy in our subject disaplin:
* Assessment?
* How we present topics?
* How we create resources?


Numeracy
--------

Numeracy allows us to understand the world

Computers are just giant calculators. Numeracy is the underpinning of our entire discipline.

### Concepts/ Language

* Compoud interest
* Exponentially
    * [Will A Piece Of Paper, Folded 42 Times, Reach The Moon?](http://wwvv.codersrevolution.com/blog/will-a-piece-of-paper-folded-42-times-reach-the-moon)
* Logaruthmic
    * (sound db) 10db is not twice as loud as 5db
* Inverse square law

### Numbers to understand the world
* [Vegans in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#United_Kingdom)
    * 600,000 people in the UK are vegan
    * This means little without knowing the population of the UK
* A tree is 50% water. What % mass of a tree comes from the soil?
    * 1% - the other 49% is carbon from the air
* > The report says 8.2% of people aged 16-64 - some 3.4 million people in total - had never had a paid job.
    * [Resolution Foundation: Never-ever](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/01/Never-ever.pdf)
* What are the biggest killers of young people in the UK?
    * [health-profile-for-england-2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-profile-for-england-2018/chapter-2-trends-in-mortality)

### The bias in numbers
* Correlation is not the same as causation
    * [Piracy on the high seas Vs Global temperature](https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/hilarious-graphs-and-pirates-prove-that-correlation-is-not-causation)
    * [Why drink is the secret to humanity’s success](https://www.ft.com/content/c5ce0834-9a64-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)
        * Drinker live longer!? It's actually social connections

#### Activity: Brainstorm/Discuss
What statistics in school research could be misused and misinterpreted

### Activity: Brainstorm/Discuss
* What activities in computing can we make numeracy explicit?
* How could we convey to students the context/power their numeracy might have in the future

### Computing activity suggestion?
How Surveys are done - how extrapolated
Take a survey in school. Deliberatly select students at random ensuring a spread of year group, gender
Expand this to numbers of pupils
Could create a webform (this will immediatly get spammed) discussion point.

### Numeracy in Computing - AI (The most powerful use of data)

Most of the general public are totally clueless about what AI (the publicly understood term) actually is.
AI's are nural networks statistics based.
They are a set of weighted mathmatical rules generated by a training dataset

[MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)

#### Ethical considerations of what data we train them with
* If we are using AI to train a medical system, what if our training dataset is just white males?
* [Hanna Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzhpf1Ai7Z4) Explanation of AI on society

### Teachers and statistics
As humans (teacher and students alike) we need to _heavily scrutinise statistics_. (Especially _Education Research_)


Citizenship
-----------

Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC)
Fundamental British Values (FBV)

### Activity: Research

Visit the following site (5min)
* [doingsmsc.org.uk/british-values/](http://www.doingsmsc.org.uk/british-values/)

What implications will this have for you teaching Computing?


### Teacher Standards

> not undermining fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect, and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs

[Teacher Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)


### Ofsted EIF (Education Inspection Framework)

> (Citizenship) equips pupils with the cultural capital they need to succeed in modern Britain

> The Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) recently tweeted news of the outcome of an Ofsted pilot visit with the new EIF where a school in Dorset was put into special measures because the deep dive showed that it failed to offer a sufficiently rich and balanced curriculum that included subjects and aspects such as Citizenship, FBV and could not fully promote pupils’ SMSC development. This underlines the dangers lurking for those schools that have downgraded their provision for Citizenship in the curriculum and their promotion of FBV and SMSC under the current inspection framework.

> there are very encouraging signs that schools will have considerable opportunities to make their Citizenship provision and its contribution to FBV and SMSC an explicit part of the curriculum and the conversations they have with inspectors
