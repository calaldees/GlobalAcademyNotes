CS Unplugged
============

Async
-----

* Many aspects of computing can be taught without a computer.
* Watch the following trailer video
    * [Computer Science Unplugged trailer](https://youtu.be/KOYy4kyLEHs) 3min
* This adds an extra dimension of excitement and intrigue. Magic tricks can form discussion points. These physical activities are memorable and powerful.
* There are lots of resources out there. The trick is YOU knowing what's out their and digesting the activities so that you can run them.
    * As a group we can explore 10hours+ of reading/exploring and share it with the group

TASK: (2 hours total)
* Goal: To have 3 activities that you could run for a class with 0min notice.
    * e.g.
        * The network is down
        * There is a power cut
        * You are asked to cover another teachers lesson and no work has been set
        * You are asked to give a 1 hour workshop to a group of visiting primary students in the school hall
        * It's the last day of term and students are not particularly focused and want to do something different
    * Consider having the various printouts you would need to have ready _on standby_ in your classroom
        * I know in covid times some of these activities may not be appropriate, but it wont be this way forever!

1. Explore a range of CS Unplugged activities (1 hour 30 min) - consider 3 activities
    * Put links to the activies that you have settled on in Google Doc
2. Describe some of the activities your explored to the group (30 min)

Some ideas and consolidating thoughts

Sequence
--------

demo making tea
lighting a candle

* Parity Puzzle - I'm reading your minds - I'm psycic
    * [An Honest Liar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2246565/) Documentary 2014 -
        * The life and career of the renowned stage magician turned scientific skeptic of the paranormal, James Randi.


Assembly Idea?
--------------

* Each student given unique sudoku problem (batch generated by code)
* Explain the rules of sudoku
* I will write some code to solve sudoku - while the class/assembly solves the paper problems
* 30 Mortals vs 1 'Computer + Programmer' - play the _Mortal Kombat_ soundtrack
* [hackertyper.net](https://hackertyper.net/) - fun hacker stereotype simulator in a webbrowser - each keypress types 3 characters from a random linux source file
    * You can upload your own file
* Get the program to list and solve every problem that was given to the room (in realtime)

With code: One person on the planet solve the problem 'once' and it's solved forever

> The pen is mightier than the sword - a computer may be mightier than the pen

* If you could use a computer properly - if you could code ... 
* you could use it for incredible personal gain, maximise output, control information
* or 
* you could use it to empower people, grow community's, foster collaboration and share the expanded capabilities with humanity
* The choice is yours, but only if you know how to use the tool
* Otherwise ... you don't get a choice, you'll be solving somebody else's (possibly meaningless) sudokus

    * Sony's manufacturing plant in Japan uses 26 robots to assemble consoles faster and more efficiently
