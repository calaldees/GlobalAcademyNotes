Session 1
---------

* [a breif history of learning theorys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgnd4rj2pT8)
    * 1950's
        * Behaviourism (Pavlov and Skinner 195x?) - rote learning
            * Desired behaviour rewarded
            * undesired behaviour punished
    * 1960's
        * Cognitivisum (Neisser 1967) - mental action or process of learning - brain is a computer
            * Revision for exams
    * 1970's
        * Constructivism (Bruner and Piaget)
            * Building our own understanding (requires effort)
            * Knowledge is constructed and not transmitted
    * 1980's
        * Socio Constructivism (Vytgostky 1978)
            * Piaget rejection _passive assimilation_
            * compare with other
            * Contextualisations and social interactions
            * Increased Motivation
            * Deep learning
            * Independent thoughts
    * 1990's ?? Experiential Learning (Kolb)
        * Kolb Cycle - reflect -> practice -> reflect -> practice

* [Course Design: constructive alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5hpRX5ZeIc) (Biggs 1999)
    * Constructive alignment (all the below should be aligned)
        * Intended learning outcomes 
            * (Bigs and Tang) statements from students perspective
            * Action verbs - design, plan, analyse

        * Assessment Feedback Tasks


* [Ray Land on Threshold Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNQAWFzULE&feature=emb_logo)
    * Gifted students still get stuck on aspects of their learning
    * Lenses are useful tools, but- focus/highlight an area and blur/background others
    * Inform curriculum design
        * Change the mode (field trip, lab, paper, theory)
    * Threshold concepts are (not in video)
        * Transformative
        * Irreversible
        * Integrative - expose previous hidden interrelatedness
        * Troublesome

Fixed/Growth Mindset (Dweeck 2006)


### OPAR framework
The most important thing to remember is: what do you want students to have learnt by the end of the session and how will you know to what extent they have learnt it?
* Orient
    * What’s the topic?
    * Why does this topic matter (to students/field/world)?
    * What do students already know about the subject?
    * How can you relate today’s topic to what students already know?
    * (5-10 minute chunk – ideally interactive/stimulating)
* Present
    * What are the core concepts/skills that you need to demonstrate or explain to students? 
    * How can you most effectively communicate these?
    * (5-10 min chunks)
* Apply
    * What can you feasibly get students to do during teaching time to let them practice the skill or applying the concepts/knowledge?
    * (In a 50 minute session, aim for 20+ mins of activities and remember to time allow for activity feedback/presentation)
* Review
    * How do you know that the students have learnt what you wanted them to have learnt?
    * (E.g. quiz, demonstration, presentation, poster-presentation, student generated summary, visiting working groups and listening-in)
    * Have you linked that back to the session aims?
    * In an hour long session you’d aim to spend the last 10 min on this

### Active Learning

* [Active Learning](http://geoffpetty.com/for-teachers/active-learning/) - Geoff Petty
    * set activities that require students to make their own meanings of the concepts
    * Same and different
        * one they are familiar with, and one they are presently studying
    * Graphic organisers
        * self-assess their own diagram using a model diagram provided by you
    * Decisions-Decisions
        * given a set of cards to match, group, rank, or sequence
            * order of importance, then sort them by who benefits, customer, business, supplier, or investor
            reject your 'spurious' cards
    * Feedback
        * self assessment and peer assessment
    * Hypothesis testing
        * a statement that is partly true, but partly false "The more advertising the better"
* Activities
    * [Formative Teaching Methods](http://geoffpetty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FormativeTeachingMethods2.doc)
        * active methods that provide the learner and the teacher with feedback

Groundrules for self and peer assessment
students must enter into the methods with the right spirit
Try to agree the following with your students
We will learn best if we all agree that

A Handbook for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, fourth edition. Abingdon: Routledge. eBook publication date: 2015

Chapter 5 - Student Learning

HE Higher education not mass leccutre
Blame students as poor learners

Life skills, graducate attributes

Students learn by - doing
Teaching is hard
Graduates should be able to - reflect
Main challenge - too much ephemeral practical content

lense of 'not empty' - what do they have already and build on it

surface approach - just the test
deep approach - wholistic

constructivly aligned curriculum
differneceiated learning + encourage experiemntal creativity
protect against burnout

Students kind of default to _surface_
persuade them to swich mode to _deep_

Biggs and Tang 2009 - SOLO taxonomy
Pre structureal: misses the point
* unistructural: part of knowlege
* Multistructural: many facts, but not structured
* Relational: makes sense of key facts
* extended abstract: coherant whole
(verbs to define)

socio constructivisum


zone of proximal development (ZPD) - what learning is posisible in the environment - scaffold
communities of practice - learning communities
Legitimate periferal particippation - novice members of the comunit are given oppertunityes to be compitent participants (Lave and Wenger 1991)
 - thing pracgtice of excusion might be embedded

 


Kolb cycle
* Reflective observation (divergent)
* abstract conceptulisation (assimilation)
* Active exerpimentation (convergent)
* concreat experience (accomodator)

Myers Biggs inventory - bollox?


IQ is not correlated with bias




### PGCAP Success

Ongoing practice
Reflection ongoing
Schedule a build-up of evidence throughout the term - schedule
09:56
Model the behaviours we expect from our students
09:56
Schedule reading tasks
09:57
Always more stuff to do than there is time to do it. Understand urgent tasks are not always the most important
09:57
Make time!
09:58
Plan to get observed sooner rather than later
09:58
Solicit advice from peers
09:59
Engage with peers in an active way
10:00
Safe space - mindful that we should all be comfortable in making mistakes

Quiz's
-----

Kahoot - Rank annoys me (speed of answer shit) - music annoys me - I'm disadvantages by reading speed - Use Anoniumus name fro avoid highscore crap
'Shiny interactive tool'ed out

Anonnimous feedback - how?



---


Give the facts - pracice the task
Core psycology menonics
Sometimes just have to lecture
Done the reading - have to comment

Just given reading - they dont have the skills to digest it

---

Designate a note-taker


Debate?
Solo
How a theory or concpet ment a log to you and changed you


Done the reading - but don't have the skills to actually have got anything from it

          > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
          > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

### What is a university
* Liberal
    * Self realisation, meritocracy, knowledge is good
* Professional Formation
    * Gatekeepers to professions

#### Barnetts types of university (2011)
(not really a type? they all encompase this)
1. Metaphysical
    * Develop as human beings, Freedom from ignorance, surer relationship with the world
2. Scientific
    * new knowleghe (research)
3. Entrepreneurial
    * Link to capital. Social as well as financial > growth

* National Student Survey + other metrics now publicly visible
* Covid and 'value for money' debate

### Quality Assurance
What, why, who, how, where, when, how assessed, how evaluated

PGCE: Self-reflective, critical practitioners

Teaching is highly political - Ideology will influence curriculum design (1999 Toohey)

* Academic Planning process
* Program validation
* Periodc Origramme review
* Regulations polices
* External examiners

Students (now paying a lot) and investors





Session 2
---------

School approach - set the tasks
 self effacacy

### Barriers 
* fear
* self confidence, self esteem
* time
* prior education
* mature students (out of water?)
* Prior knowlege (expected?) review
* IT knowlege (for old and young) and teachers - we are all aweful

Cool quote:
"Uni is like paying Gym fees - you've got to show up"

### Support
* Well-being advisor
* Disability service
* Chaplaincy
* Peer mentoring
* Meditation services
* Students union advice

powerpoint has live subttling - live - presentation mode then TAB 'captioning/subtitling'

already
 respect individual learners
 promote partcipation (equality of oppertunity)
what now

I have a ADHD student. They have requested more breaks in sessions.
I have an older student that has alienated themselves for peer support network (they were kicked from WhatsApp group due to condescending/offensive comments) . Integrating them into group discussions is now much harder and I cant use pair work as most students in the group are on edge when working 1-to-1 with them.
To make progress I'm always using groups of 3+


Read reflections and show you care about the student

Support the student - look at wellbeing - identify the root causese. _Identifying_ is the majority of the battle

### Reflection, reflection, reflection (Dye)

[Developing reflective practice: a guide for beginning teachers](http://www.vlebooks.com/Vleweb/Product/Index/155556) McGregor, Debra 2011

Chapter 13 by Vanessa Dye 'Reflection, reflection, reflection, I'm thinking all the time, why do I need a theory or model of reflection?', pp. 217-234 in  Developing Reflective Practice,  (2011), ed. Deborah McGregor & Lesley Cartwright. 

* "So how is 'reflection' different from the thinking I do anyway?"
* When we look in a mirror, we may be prompted to take some action to improve what we see, especially first thing in the morning.
* The process of becoming a reflective practitioner cannot be prescribed (Larrivee 2000)
* "reflecting, reflecting, reflecting I think all the time, don't I? What is it with this reflection thing that makes it so important?" (Ottensen 2007)
* We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience. (Dewey 1933)
* Reflection 
    * has _direction_
    * Reflection combines practice and theory
        * A reflective practitioner will develop your own theories and models of teaching
* Journal
    * Keeping a journal helps to review experiences in a more formal way than just thinking about something. Writing about an experience may promote you to think more carefully, as explaining it and committing it to paper for someone else to understand means you have to revisit key events and think more deeply about them.
* SOS Model - Self, Others, Situation
* separate personal self from your professional self
* writing free from the police officer of your mind - need to be aware of the need for professional language. Your diary entries should be written for someone who can give you constructive and developmental support in building your skills
    * "Reflective practice seems to perpetuate the current policy climate in education, which is dominated by systems of surveillance. Though the process I have opened up my professions and to some extent personal identity to the scrutiny of not only peers but also tutors. In my experience this reduces the liberating element of reflection and replaces it with performance anxiety."
* Critical Incidents in Teaching: Developing Professional Judgement (Tripp 1993)
    * [vlebooks](https://www.vlebooks.com/Vleweb/Product/Index/1994921)
    * [Critical incidents according to Tripp](https://www.nicole-brown.co.uk/critical-incidents-according-to-tripp/) Nicole Brown - web summary
    * Something that made you stop and think
    * Relevant
        * Not necessarily serious or dangerous
        * Possibly something that happens _frequently_
    * e.g.
        * Two students repeatedly chatting/laughing in a lecture
        * Majority of students hadn't prepared for a session
        * Student explains to you why they haven't been able to engage with a learning resource you'd provided
        * You see a recording of yourself delivering a presentation and realise they you talk really quickly when you're nervous
* gain insight into bigger picture. This is when reflection overlaps with critical thinking (mezirow 1998, McGuinness 2005; McGregor 2007)

#### Summary

Powerful reflection contains
* What (concise description)
* Why the incident mattered (So What)
* Other viewpoints (interpretation, feedback)
* Other approaches (theory, colleagues)
* Bias
* Awareness of reflective process (limitations)
* Actions / Future Changes
* Summary


### The Park (Example reflections)

#### Example 1
Not really a reflection. More of an account of the events. 
Mentioned 'upset' but did not dissect why.
Not focus on topic. Multiple thoughts ideas and memories that are irrelevant to the incident.

#### Example 2
Focused on the event with a description of the setting (how/why she was their).
Some identification of why the others had not acted.
Gave own personal reasons for not acting.
Manifestations of guilt but no direction of action.

#### Example 3
Sharp/breif desciption of what happened.
Much more focus on own feelings + asking why actions had/had-not been taken.
What could have been done differnety
Questions personal identity 'I do not usually do wrong'
Further areas of life - linking to other related past experiences

#### Example 4
Breakdown of own throught process's
Own rational. why there was doubt, dressed? play acting?
Reconsile 'good person' with actions - am not always a good person
Consider possible bias's
Admit attitude nearly resulted in death


Session 4
---------





Prep slides
-----------

* What know, what not know
* Metric justification
* indipendent work to deadlines

D Bound
1. Measure achievement
2. Engender leaning
3. Develop graduate attributes

Principles of assessment
* Achive set learning outcomes
* Contributes to learning, engagement
* Authentic (reflects work-context, graduate attributes)
* Manageable
* inclusive
    * choice of task
    * understand the purpose and process of assessment

* Formative assessment
* Summative Assessment

* Assessment criteria
* Grade descriptor

* Nom-referenced assessment
    * only 20% are awarded destination (of cohort)
* Criterion-referenced assessment

Qualitys of effective feedback
1. Timely
    * (Uni 15 day turnaround)
2. Facilitates development of self-assessment (reflection)
3. High quality information to students about their learning
4. Encouarges teacher peer dialog
5. Encourages positive motivational belifes and sel-steam
6. provide oppertunity to close gap between current ans desired performance
7. Assist with further teacher planning

Giving feedback
* proise stratergy and effort
* engage student directly
* constuctive (rather than descriptive)
* encourage students to make use of feedback (give specific activity to act on feedback)
* Present mistakes as learning oppertunities


Session 4

Why
Did they lean what's expected?
Support
Progress
Measure performance
Identify
Benchmark comparions, class, institution
Assessment to help students self regulate

SMART Objectives
Specific
Aeasurable
Achivable
Realistic
Timebound

Assessment-critera/Sylibus presented at the begining of course
Facilitate self-evaluation

13:30 to 13:50

Stress of getting responses from students

Stress from getting responses from students remotely
If not summative-graded - students may not engage
Continuous verbal feedback on practical tasks
Students not engaging with pre-reading
Reading reflections and commenting on reflection progress in 1-to-1 meetings
Feedback about study skills and attendance

No point in giving feedback that outstripts the students engagement
Focus/Limit feedback to specific target item - Leverage

Submit one draft for feedback - summative is grade only (because students complain about inconsistent marking)

Feedback for draft progress - recorded (verbally is not sufficent?)
Grade only for summative

Feedback authtnetic and matters
Timely
Mark the work, not the individual?

### Activity
1. Focus - borderline fail / pass
    * focus on one point - little sense of direction/conclusion
    * does have conclusion

    * It is possible to disguise an instructor’s gender identity online. 
    * assistant instructors in an online class each operated under two different gender identities.
