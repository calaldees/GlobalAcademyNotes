        * Integrative - expose previous hidden interrelatedness
        * Troublesome

Fixed/Growth Mindset (Dweeck 2006)


### OPAR framework
The most important thing to remember is: what do you want students to have learnt by the end of the session and how will you know to what extent they have learnt it?
* Orient
    * What’s the topic?
    * Why does this topic matter (to students/field/world)?
    * What do students already know about the subject?
    * How can you relate today’s topic to what students already know?
    * (5-10 minute chunk – ideally interactive/stimulating)
* Present
    * What are the core concepts/skills that you need to demonstrate or explain to students? 
    * How can you most effectively communicate these?
    * (5-10 min chunks)
* Apply
    * What can you feasibly get students to do during teaching time to let them practice the skill or applying the concepts/knowledge?
    * (In a 50 minute session, aim for 20+ mins of activities and remember to time allow for activity feedback/presentation)
* Review
    * How do you know that the students have learnt what you wanted them to have learnt?
    * (E.g. quiz, demonstration, presentation, poster-presentation, student generated summary, visiting working groups and listening-in)
    * Have you linked that back to the session aims?
    * In an hour long session you’d aim to spend the last 10 min on this

### Active Learning

* [Active Learning](http://geoffpetty.com/for-teachers/active-learning/) - Geoff Petty
    * set activities that require students to make their own meanings of the concepts
    * Same and different
        * one they are familiar with, and one they are presently studying
    * Graphic organisers
        * self-assess their own diagram using a model diagram provided by you
    * Decisions-Decisions
        * given a set of cards to match, group, rank, or sequence
            * order of importance, then sort them by who benefits, customer, business, supplier, or investor
            reject your 'spurious' cards
    * Feedback
        * self assessment and peer assessment
    * Hypothesis testing
        * a statement that is partly true, but partly false "The more advertising the better"
* Activities
    * [Formative Teaching Methods](http://geoffpetty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FormativeTeachingMethods2.doc)
        * active methods that provide the learner and the teacher with feedback

Groundrules for self and peer assessment
students must enter into the methods with the right spirit
Try to agree the following with your students
We will learn best if we all agree that


Questions for another group - simple, medium, advanced

A Handbook for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, fourth edition. Abingdon: Routledge. eBook publication date: 2015

Chapter 5 - Student Learning

HE Higher education not mass leccutre
Blame students as poor learners

Life skills, graducate attributes

Students learn by - doing
Teaching is hard
Graduates should be able to - reflect
Main challenge - too much ephemeral practical content

lense of 'not empty' - what do they have already and build on it

surface approach - just the test
deep approach - wholistic

constructivly aligned curriculum
differneceiated learning + encourage experiemntal creativity
protect against burnout

Students kind of default to _surface_
persuade them to swich mode to _deep_

Biggs and Tang 2009 - SOLO taxonomy
Pre structureal: misses the point
* unistructural: part of knowlege
* Multistructural: many facts, but not structured
* Relational: makes sense of key facts
* extended abstract: coherant whole
(verbs to define)

socio constructivisum


zone of proximal development (ZPD) - what learning is posisible in the environment - scaffold
communities of practice - learning communities
Legitimate periferal particippation - novice members of the comunit are given oppertunityes to be compitent participants (Lave and Wenger 1991)
 - thing pracgtice of excusion might be embedded

 


Kolb cycle
* Reflective observation (divergent)
* abstract conceptulisation (assimilation)
* Active exerpimentation (convergent)
* concreat experience (accomodator)

Myers Biggs inventory - bollox?


IQ is not correlated with bias




### PGCAP Success

Ongoing practice
Reflection ongoing
Schedule a build-up of evidence throughout the term - schedule
09:56
Model the behaviours we expect from our students
09:56
Schedule reading tasks
09:57
Always more stuff to do than there is time to do it. Understand urgent tasks are not always the most important
09:57
Make time!
09:58
Plan to get observed sooner rather than later
09:58
Solicit advice from peers
09:59
Engage with peers in an active way
10:00
Safe space - mindful that we should all be comfortable in making mistakes

Quiz's
-----

Kahoot - Rank annoys me (speed of answer shit) - music annoys me - I'm disadvantages by reading speed - Use Anoniumus name fro avoid highscore crap
'Shiny interactive tool'ed out

Anonnimous feedback - how?



---


Give the facts - pracice the task
Core psycology menonics
Sometimes just have to lecture
Done the reading - have to comment

Just given reading - they dont have the skills to digest it

---

Designate a note-taker


Debate?
Solo
How a theory or concpet ment a log to you and changed you


Done the reading - but don't have the skills to actually have got anything from it

          > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
          > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negatice attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.
