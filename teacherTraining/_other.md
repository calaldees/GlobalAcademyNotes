* [The role of beliefs in teacher agency](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13540602.2015.1044325)
    * Teach agency - should teachers have freedom or should they be directed
        * beliefs about children and young people; 
        * beliefs about teaching;
        * beliefs about the purposes of education
    * ?
        * routine (acquired patterns of action), 
        * or on purpose (motivating ‘forces’), 
        * or on judgement (the engagement with the situation in the here-and-now).
    * chordal triad of agency (Emirbayer and Mische 1998)
        * influences from the past, (iterational) (habbit)
        * orientations towards the future (projective) (imagination)
        * and engagement with the present. (practical–evaluative) (judgement)
    * > The comparative lack of a clear vision about what education is for seems to seriously limit the possibilities for action to develop a good education
