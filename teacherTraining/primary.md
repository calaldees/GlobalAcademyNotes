Case Study: Average unnamed primary school
------------------------------------------

* Computing was allocated 1 hour a week
  * Computing was always the first subject to be dropped
  * Canceled once every 2 weeks -  christmass play, other activities
* Computer rooms
  * One computer room
  * No inhouse technician
    * An external tech visited once a week
  * A shared resource was often kept in a poor state
  * Timing of the hours lesson
    * 10min transport to computer room
    * 10min to log in (an alien concept for most children)
      * Most forget password
        * and have it written in planners and forget planners and cant read back writing
    * only 30min max of actual teaching
* Staff Digital Literacy
  * Very low - average people can't really use computers effectively
* Resources and planning
  * Most lessons are 'read from script'
    * difficult for teachers to resolve problems as they don't have the depth of understanding
      * Teachers told solution but cant debug
        * Often quote "Let's start again" as the only way forward
      * Most children are left unguided
  * Lesson scheems of work are often paid bundles with web resorurces
    * Lesson activities are web based (no need to install anything)
      * Extra layer of logins (machine login and website login)
* Reporting
  * no reporting of grade specific to computing
    * very soft data
      * "well in geography and history, struggling in french"

resistance to change - security in routineen - change percived as bad bad bad
no assessment of computing - most marking maths english every day - just AfL
3 or 4 doing well - doing it at home - persionally exited about it
Lots of verbal feedback with teacher and parents
  really good at computing
handover contact
5 stage behaviour bed blue talk to parents
  talk to parents - have access to computer - 3min per dat conversation
  secondary anonimity is problematic
Dont shake the screen
  threw mouse at screen
just use computer room for unstructured homework

ipad trolly
logon iis fourign concept - passowrd utter difficulty
monitor on is turning comuter on !!?! - no desktop at home
apps for coding on ipads
using comuters in the style that young people can understand
They are confused by desktops
Alienating - dont even know what login means - write down password - cant - wrote it down in pkanner - cant remember planner cant read what wrote down
cant type in url - site has differnt username and differnt password
just getting onto a coputer is a feat of volor
why interact with computer after 20min of pain to get there

disscusspon pint - face login


activities for computing activities in primary

opertunity to explore? time on computers
 - just paint
 

connecting the bridge between desktop and tablet

coding games

maths teacher 3 times a foughtnight liase from secondary to primay
Bridge the gap
7-14 for all subjects
Specifically computing could be huge advantage
Year 6 connect - time that noone has
own free periods with ajoined primary school

Give year 7 more support - with understanding of year 6's - we don't know

StPeters - look at ofstead report
