Computing in Primary Schools
============================

Objectives:
* Explore the primary national curriculum for computing
* Be familiar with how the approach to teaching computing in primary differs from secondary
* Consider how this knowledge will influence your planning and understanding of KS3

Disclaimer:
* I'm not a primary school teacher ... I don't have firsthand experience of the area ... however ...
* I am interested in the topic and spent the past month reading articles, talking to actual primary teachers, watching videos, buying books and exploring software.
* This session is an open discussion of what I've found so far
* Let's use this time to explore the topic


National Curriculum
-------------------

* Historicity
  * The curriculum used detailed _levels_
  * Teachers were expected to
    * assess sublevels, progression, marking, evidence
  * This was too heavy, too prescribed
* Now
  * It's a couple of bullet points on 1 page of A4

* Statutory guidance [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
  * The statutory programmes of study and attainment targets for computing at key stages 1 to 4.
  * [stem.org.uk Computing in the National Curriculum: a Guide for Primary Teachers](https://www.stem.org.uk/elibrary/resource/34863)
  * [Computing: interview with Mark Dorling](http://youtu.be/NwXjGMpWprI)


Ofsted Inspections
------------------

* To my knowlege; no school has failed an ofstead inspection because of poor Computing.
  * Until a school fails with this criteria, the focus will always be on English/Maths
* [iCompute-and-Ofsted](https://www.icompute-uk.com/Downloads/iCompute-and-Ofsted.pdf) - Questions Ofsted will ask primary practitioners


Case Study: Average unnamed primary school
------------------------------------------

* Computing was allocated 1 hour a week
  * Computing was always the first subject to be dropped
  * Canceled once every 2 weeks -  christmass play, other activities

* Computer rooms
  * One computer room for a small school
    * A shared resource was often kept in a poor state
      * Many machines broken because lack of individual responsibility
      * Much time spent moving children to different machines (adding to teacher/pupil frustration)
  * No in-house technician - An external tech visited once a week
    * Installing new software often a blocker/problem

* Timing of the hour a week lesson
  * 10min transport/travel to computer room
  * 10min to log in (an alien concept for most children)
    * Most forget password - password barrier to entry - their computers at home don't have them
      * Have password written in planners
        * forget planners
        * cant read back writing
    * Many technical issues (see above)
  * Only 30min max of actual teaching
    * Demoralized: Why interact with computer after 20min of pain to get there

Discuss: Could facial recondition be used to speedup login? Good or bad idea and why? Is this legal or not legal?

* Mobile computer-room - Tablet Trolly
  * Using computers in the style that young people can understand
  * Apps for coding on iPads

* Confused by desktops
  * Turning monitor on is turning computer on !!?!
  * No desktop at home
    * No understanding of keyboard and mouse
      * Poor motor control

* Staff Digital Literacy
  * Very low - average people can't really use computers effectively

* Resources and planning
  * Most lessons are 'read from script'
    * difficult for teachers to resolve problems as they don't have the depth of understanding
      * Teachers told solution but cant debug
        * Often quote "Let's start again" as the only way forward
      * Most children are left unguided
  * Lesson schemes of work are often paid bundles with web resources
    * Lesson activities are web based (no need to install anything)
      * Extra layer of logins (machine login and website login)
  * Solving the access to computers/software
    * Website - all in one resources
      * Students struggle to type urls (combination of case and strange symbols)
      * Sites have different username and different password - more blockers

* Reporting
  * No reporting of grade specific to computing
    * very soft data
      * "doing well in geography and history, struggling in french"
  * No assessment of computing
    * Most marking maths english every day - just AfL
  * Daily possibility of catchup with parents as children are collected
    * Nod/Wave
    * Normally chat about behaviour if needed
      * (Side note: anonymity in secondary school is problematic)
    * Lots of verbal feedback with teacher and parents
      * "really good at computing"

* A few pupils will be very capable
  * Because they are personally exited about computing - doing it at home

* Behaviour
  * "Don't shake the screen"
  * Throw mouse at screen


Structured time?
----------------

* Computer room is often used for for unstructured homework

In the context of primary education ...

Discussion: With such rigorous goals for the whole of the education system. Is there any benefit in letting young people explore computers. They don't use keyboards and mice at home. Just let them use paint. Click on a few bits. Just have time on one.


Teacher Resource Case Studies
-----------------------------

### Book: Teaching Primary Computing (Martin Burrett)

Year 1: (Age 4)
* Moving a sprite in scratch
* Image manipulation
  * Hue shift
  * Cut paste

Year 6:
* App design
  * http://appshed.com/
* Game design (and make it)
  * title screen
  * game over screen
  * design levels
* Edit videos
  * Make documentartys/advert
  * Chroma key backgronds

#### My comments/observations

Given that year 1
* can't read
* can't easily use a keyboard and mouse
* get sporadic access to a poorly maintained computer room
Is scratch programing realistic?

The Year 6 projects listed here are something that I wish GCSE students could do.


### Book: Primary in action (Yasemin Allsop and Ben Sedman)

Every Chapter by a different specialist
Good chapter on assessment

CAS Primary Guidance
--------------------

[CAS Primary Computing](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/CASPrimaryComputing.pdf)

* Using a pupil-centred approach
  * Modular projects for pupils to choose from
  * Use an enquiry-based approach at the beginning of each half-termly unit:

Conclusions
-----------

* Give year 7's more support
  * With the understanding of year 6's
* Trained 7-14 practitioners for all subjects could help the transition to secondary
* Because primary schools have more contact time with a class, they can craft more cross curricular and integrated project based work
  * Secondary teaching feels anonymous and fragmented in comparison


# --------------------

resistance to change - security in routineen - change percived as bad bad bad


handover contact
5 stage behaviour bed blue talk to parents
  talk to parents - have access to computer - 3min per dat conversation

maths teacher 3 times a foughtnight liase from secondary to primay
Bridge the gap

Specifically computing could be huge advantage
Year 6 connect - time that noone has
own free periods with ajoined primary school
