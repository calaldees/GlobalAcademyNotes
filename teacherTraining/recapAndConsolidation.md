Recap and Consolidation (2 hours)
=======================

* Intro (10min)
* Async (1 hour) Build a mind map
* Sync (30min) Discussion of the map
* Knowledge bases and tools (20min)

* You are now beginning to build your own experiences of teaching Computing in schools (all be it limited by remote teaching)
* I am interested in using technology to build a mini group knowledge base
* It would be useful for us to experience this to judge if this is a pedagogical tool you could utilise in school
* It will also give me the ability to analyses the learning and experiences you have had so far.

Group Collaborative Mind Map (1 hour)
-------------------------------------
Async

There are a range of online mind map tools.
I've decided to experiment with `coggle.it` as the interface and output looks beautiful

* Apologies: Sadly you need to sign in with a federated provider to collaborate - I will send an email to your university account


Personal Knowledge Base
-----------------------

* Foam?
* Obsidian?

Map of Computing - example

* [Everything I Know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) - Another knowledge base (that's awesome)


Collaborative Knowledge Base
---------------------------

### Collaborative Wiki
* [WikiBooks: A-level Computing/AQA 2015 spec](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA)
* GitHub repo
    * Collaborate with other teachers
* [Map of Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA) 10min video
