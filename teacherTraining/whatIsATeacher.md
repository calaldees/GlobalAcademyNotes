* [Contructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centered learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)

        * > “Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely.” (Klahr & Nigam, 2004)
        * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all
        * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
        * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species
