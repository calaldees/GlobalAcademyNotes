Session 2 - What is a Teacher
=============================


* Learning Objectives
    * Understand and explore past experiences that bias, impact and influence values and beliefs regarding effective teaching (ethno-autobiography, epistemology and ontology)
    * Introduce key essential successful subject teacher characteristics and a range of pedagogical approaches
    * Development of subject; Subject Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge

* What is a Computer Science teacher?
* What is Computer Science specific pedagogy?
* Differences between _subject knowledge_ and 
* Recent influences in Computing teaching
    * Demands of modern-society and modern-computing compared with classical-computing
* SKA and development
* Set SP assignment


What is Computer Science specific pedagogy?
-------------------------------------------

TASK: How might teaching computing be different from other subjects?

_subject pedagogy_ is the _how do we teach computing_

Recent influences in Computing teaching
---------------------------------------

Demands of modern-society.
Modern-computing compared with classical-computing.

We need to tackle this misconception between what the average person thinks of computing and what the academic discipline is.

TASK: What do we mean 
* classical-computing?
* modern-computing?

Traditional mathematical components of computing - theoretical underpinning
* binary number representation, algorithm design, algorithm complexity, NAND gates, processor architecture

The modern reality and use of computers as seen by society is very different. These feel like secondary order effects of computing
* Single board computers, Voice UI, AI/Behaviour/DataScience, BioInfomatics

Remember society bundles Computing, ICT, Digital Literacy into the same pot.



Terminology
-----------

* [Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))
    * > formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts
* [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)
    * The theory/nature of knowledge
        * arrived at independent of experience (e.g. through logic - rationalist, intuition - non-rational)
        * empirical (verifiable by observation), or arrived at through experience
* [Autoethnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoethnography)
    * a form of qualitative research in which an author uses self-reflection and writing to explore anecdotal and personal experience and connect this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings
    * > autoethnographers are themselves the primary participant/subject of the research


Cognitive Bias
--------------

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€“ and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman

You have bias's because you are a human.
As humans We must be aware of our bias's

TASK 1: Brainstorm all the bias's you can think of

TASK 2: Compare your list to these lists

Action point: I recommend you refer/remind yourself of these bias's regularly.


Ofsted Inspection Criteria
--------------------------

* [Education inspection framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/education-inspection-framework) EIF
    * [Inspecting schools: guide for maintained and academy schools ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/inspecting-schools-guide-for-maintained-and-academy-schools)
    * [Research_for_EIF_framework](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/813228/Research_for_EIF_framework_100619__16_.pdf) 2019


Previously the hot topic was _Pupil Impact_. It was all about impact, impact, impact, impact, impact!

The new hot topic is apparently _Research led_.
