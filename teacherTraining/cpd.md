## ITT Core Framework
> 8.1
> Effective professional development is likely to be sustained over time, involve expert support or coaching and opportunities for collaboration.

> 8.2
> Reflective practice, supported by feedback from and observation of experienced colleagues, professional debate, and learning from educational research, is also likely to support improvement

> 8.7
> Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve


NQT Year

Action in your NQT year
-----------------------

What do you want you CV to look like?
Small token actions that mount up
Talking points at an interview for a future role

### 1 day plans

* Organize 1 day in a feeder primary school
* Run 1 workshop (30min) for staff in your school
    * TASK: think of a specialist area you might be able to present?
* Organize 1 external speaker
    * TASK: Identify 2 people in your network who could talk about their role
* Run 1 after school cool thing
    * TASK:
* Attend 1 teacher meet
    * CAS Hub
    * Request exam board training - Network!

### Ongoing

Importance of networking throughout your career.
You need to be proactive in seeking this out.

* Consistent coaching (Leverage observations)
    * With time allocated to do this (you should be doing this as part of NQT)
    * Invite another teacher (from another subject) into your classroom
* Wider community
    * Mobile App - [TeacherTapp](https://teachertapp.co.uk/)
        * Ask questions, See results, Access ongoing CPD
    * 1 blog post a week?
* Pair (regularly with colleagues/mentor)
    * (Pair Programming - sounds like madness, it's enlightening!)
    * Pair planning (15min a week)
        * Pay attention to the learning that you are planning for pupils and the formative assessment you can use to evaluate the learning.
        * It’s helpful to be able to try out this lesson and then get together to reflect and discuss how it went.
    * Pair marking (15min a week)
        * Particularly more experienced ones!
        * Mark some work together and identify what it tells you about student learning
        * You can then discuss the most appropriate teaching strategies for the subsequent lessons
* Strategies
    * Improving pupils outcomes is not just _in lesson_ teaching strategies
        * How to reduce marking and improve quality of feedback

Instructional Coaching - [Top-down observation and feedback models are flawed. Time for change](https://teacherhead.com/2020/01/25/top-down-observation-and-feedback-models-are-flawed-time-for-change/) @teacherhead


### Extra notes (some of my thoughts)

Mostly; Teachers have enough subject knowledge. It's the other skills they need to develop.

Can you learn to sing from a book?
How many hours would you contribute?
You can make some progress by self observation, but you NEED to collaborate/feedback/engage with others

You may be coming into an established department with established teachers. Part of your role is to bring new ideas and a new perspective.
You will play a major part in driving the culture forward - you are part of forging it - Be the change you want to be.



Evaluation
==========
14:42
TASK: Write a heartfelt opening-statement/advice to be read to PGCE/SD candidates on their first day next year (15min)

TASK: If time could be changed - what would be different about your training year? What could Christ Church do differently? (Say it how it is! I want to improve the course next year) (15min)

Formal Exit Survey will be coming


Continued Professional Development (CPD)
========================================

Teaching Adults

* You are now experienced at teaching young people
* You will be constantly learning throughout your teaching career
* At some point in the future you will be receiving/giving CPD
* TASK: How would your teaching be different when you are: teaching adults, teaching teachers?


Some of my thoughts:
* Much less available contact time?
    * Busy work - treading water - at your limit
* Do their objectives align with yours?
* Coaching/Collaboration (less didactic)


History of Computing CPD
------------------------

2013 - Computing National Curriculum nationwide introduced

ICT teachers were told 'teach computing'. ICT is not Computing. Senior Leadership didn't really know the difference. No one was really sure how you would teach computing on such a scale.

2016 - Education secretary said

> We will have 400 master teachers to deliver the new Computing Curriculum

> Deregulate QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) to let schools employ experts

* [400 Master Teachers](https://schoolsweek.co.uk/3m-on-and-where-are-all-the-master-teachers/)
    * £3m on and where are all the master teachers?
* [Curse of the expert](https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2013/10/michael-gove-wrong-qualified-teacher-status/)
    * Experts in subject areas does not make them good teachers


### Master Computing Teachers

* Not allocated time to share practice
* No incentive for schools to donate teacher time
* Experience varied
* No measure of impact

The master computing teacher program was failed/abandoned


Effective CPD
-------------

* You're a full time teacher. You're exhausted. Your time is full: making and planning, personal family commitments.
* Task 1: Describe 1 area you would like CPD to personally address/support you
* Task 2: What would your dream CPD session look like? What would it look like?
* Task 3: Can you give 2 examples of what does poor CPD looks like? (From your worldly experience; not necessarily applied to teaching)

### Poor CPD
One off inspirational speakers are not effective
Story: Theatre troupe. Shakespeare - dark day before the bridge

### Blockers to good CPD
* Culture
    * Nobody around you is displaying the right growth behaviour
    * How do you swim against the current?
        * Model the change/behaviour you want to see. (make the culture)
* Time
* No incentive to improve
    * Things are mostly ok (see _ok plateau_ below)

### [DfE Standard for teachers’ professional development](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-for-teachers-professional-development) (2016)

1. Professional development should have a *focus on improving and evaluating pupil outcomes*
    * Make sure they are clear about the intended outcomes of activities
    * Continually apply formative assessment to monitor progression and impact
    * Choose complementary activities aligned to a clear overall objective for their practice, pupils and school
2. Professional development should be *underpinned by robust evidence* and expertise
    * Seek to understand how and why practices work and how to implement them successfully in different contexts
    * Actively seek formative feedback on practice and support the evaluation of impact on their practice, pupil outcomes and wider school improvement
    * Expect to improve pedagogical knowledge AND subject knowledge, or specialist knowledge (e.g. for special educational needs)
3. Professional development should *include collaboration* and expert challenge
    * Seek expert support and challenge
    * Seek activities that allow adaptation of approaches for the classroom through practice
    * Implement practices with peers and focus discussion on the impact on pupils
4. Professional development programmes should be *sustained* over time
    * Seek programmes that typically last at least two terms and which provide a sustained rhythm of ongoing support.
    * Translate ideas into relevant practice and knowledge for specific classes and pupils, making time for ongoing practice and review.

And all this is underpinned by, and requires that:

5. Professional development must be *prioritised by school leadership*
    * Take responsibility for their own professional development.
    * Engage openly in discussion about the impact of teaching practice with peers and leaders supporting a culture of trust, respect and scholarship.
    * Fully commit to effective professional development practices and challenge poor or ineffective ones

### Articles about CPD

#### [ok plateau](https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/apr/11/expert-teachers-ok-plateau-professional-development) - Alex Quigley
* > common autopilot state when you have habitually mastered the basics of a task, but despite being skilled you stop really improving to reach expert status; you simply plateau in performance
* > With the storm of demands created by workload, any improvement beyond this point seemed fanciful. I stopped reading about teaching and learning and I stopped being coached with genuine regularity.


#### [Only 1% of CPD is effective](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2014/02/23/being-the-1-what-does-it-take-to-make-cpd-effective/)
* > Barely 1% of training [CUREE] looked at was effectively transforming classroom practice
* [Doug Lemov](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Perfect-Getting-Better-ebook/dp/B007ZQ34V4) has argued persuasively
    * there are three main ways schools can better the standard of teaching:
        1. labour market strategies to attract and retain good teachers;
        2. incentives and performance management to reward good practice (or punish bad);
        3. and helping existing teachers improve
* > They must win over teachers who are often suspicious when asked or required to attend development sessions.
    > (“I must be here because people question my work.”)
* > Plus there’s the plain fact that we continue to have limited insight into what works — either in the classroom or in the training sessions


#### Professor Robert Coe [Improving Education 2013](http://www.cem.org/attachments/publications/ImprovingEducation2013.pdf)

> Many of the most effective strategies are complex, open to interpretation and hard to implement.
> We may think we are doing it, but are we doing it right?
> In most cases the approach is not supported by a well-defined, feasible, large-scale intervention strategy.
> In other words, we do not know how to get large groups of teachers and schools to implement these interventions in ways that are faithful, effective and sustainable.

> We know that teaching quality is one of the main determinants of learning (Hattie, 2003; Rivkin et al, 2005; Kane et al, 2013).
> We also know that measures of teachers’ performance typically improve during the first few years of their careers, and then plateau after 3-5 years (Rockoff, 2004; Kukla-Acevedo, 2009).
> We do not know a lot about the impact of teachers’ CPD on students’ learning outcomes,
> but what we do know suggests two important things:
> that the right kinds of CPD can produce big benefits for learners,
> and that most of the CPD undertaken by teachers is not of this kind
> (Joyce and Showers, 2002; Yoon et al 2007; . Wei et al, 2009; Cordingley and Bell, 2012).

* Suggestions
    1. Get teaching really focussed on learning
        * see _Poor proxies for learning_
    2. Invest in effective professional development
    3. Use multiple sources of validated evidence to support diagnostic and constructive evaluation of teacher quality
* Non negotiable
    4. Whenever we make a change we must try to evaluate its impact as robustly as we can


Task
----
14:00 ....
TASK: Related to your current domain ...
* Imagine your can run one session for the PGCE/SD students next year.
* You have 1 session to have an impact on their teaching.
* How would you ensure this session has impact and actually makes meaningful change in their teaching?
* What would be in this session?
* What would it look like?


[Leverage observations](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2014/12/15/archimedean-leadership-2-what-are-leverage-observations-or-how-would-yo-yo-ma-feed-back/)
----------------------

* Frequency
    * Weekly observations support the introduction, adaptation and embedding of changes
* Judgment
    * No evaluation is made: the sole purpose is improvement
* Too many targets
    * Feedback focuses on one action step: the most powerful ‘lever’
* Sufficient guidance
    * The observer helps the teacher pinpoint problems and solutions; teachers are ‘given’ an answer if they struggle to reach it themselves
* Struggle implementing change
    * teachers practice the action step with their coach
* Lack of follow-up
    * The next week’s observation coaches look for evidence of the action step
* Superficiality/burden
    * one could claim superficiality, although I’d contend regular visits allow observers to familiarize themselves with teachers and classes; they add no planning or reporting burden.

We are trying to break the _ok plateau_.
*Change something* even if you think it will have little impact, it's not forever. explore, experiment, change, grow.





NOTES TODO
==========




What kind of CPD will have an impact on our students?
It should be ...
1. Intense: at least 15 contact hours, preferably 50
2. Sustained: over at least two terms
3. Content focused: on teachers’ knowledge of subject content & how students learn it
4. Active: opportunities to try it out & discuss
5. Supported: external feedback and networks to improve and sustain
6. Evidence based: promotes strategies supported by robust evaluation evidence

hang on a minuet ... that's what we do for young people? Why are we so bad at doing it for adults?

Teachers should
retain considerable autonomy over their development
avoid extensive monitoring for its own sake. un-intrusive, meaningful ways to know how teachers are improving
a culture of contagious pedagogy,
defend time











Impact Evaluation
-----------------

In business we _measure_.
Business define success criteria/targets and then work backwards.
How do we know it has impact? - The measuring is key.

Describe: _Agile Development_, _Ticket Sizing_, _Retrospectives_


Impact -> Justification -> Plan -> Deliver -> Evaluate


Thomas Guskeys five levels for evaluating CPD
* Participants Reaction
* Participants Learning
* Organization and Support
* Participants use of knowledge/skills
* Student learning outcomes
    * (Start here and work backwards) 'Backwards by design'
* Group input on impact

Senior leaders don't understand Computing
Context on how to apply this to classroom

### Poor proxies for learning
* Students are busy: lots of work is done (especially written work)
* Students are engaged, interested, motivated
* Students are getting attention: feedback, explanations
* Classroom is ordered, calm, under control
* Curriculum has been ‘covered’ (ie presented to students in some form)
* (At least some) students have supplied correct answers (whether or not they really understood them or could reproduce them independently)




Subject Pedagogy
-----------------

How to teach a subject

PRIMM
    * Predict
    * Run
    * Investigate
    * Modify
    * Make

UMCIII
    * Use
    * Modify
    * Create
    * Imitate
    * Innovate
    * Invent

Read before Write

Pair programming
Growth Mindset
Per investigation/instruction

Programming is hard -> not accurate model -> computer is magic (hope)

Comprehension oriented not creation oriented

Activity: Code Jenga






### Effective CPD
* Collaboration (nobody is an island)
    * -> from expert advisor/mentor (Who has influenced you?)
    * A network of support
* Relevant to learners (your needs are different from other teachers)
    * differentiation -> personalized

> I had the misfortune to have to sit through a 2 day lecture of his, insisted upon by my employer.
One thing I have learned during my 17 years in education is avoid Death by Power Point, and that is exactly what this guy did. I lost count of the amount of slides we went through. The college I work at sat 120 of us in front of him.  Never in my career have I seen someone actually nod off during a training lecture, but a guy at a table nearby did exactly that.
> He lost people's attention within 30 minutes.
> I've no doubt this man is highly intelligent and well respected but his presentation methods that day were awful. If I had done what he done in front of Estyn inspectors I'd have got my department sanctioned and I'd have been in front of HR.



[Building subject-specific CPD opportunities](https://impact.chartered.college/article/building-subject-specific-cpd-opportunities/) - Laura GatwardSeptember 2020
* Ideas for building subject-specific CPD:
    * Keep in contact with previous colleagues
    * Join your subject association (including their social media channels)
    * Contact your local university/college outreach department
    * Read about (and listen to/watch!) your subject
    * Work with other local departments
    * Use the evidence to highlight the importance of this with your leadership team.


* [Leading teacher collaboration in subject-specific pedagogy](https://impact.chartered.college/article/leading-teacher-collaboration-subject-specific-pedagogy/)
    * > investing in teacher learning has an effect size of 0.84 on student achievement (Robinson, 2011)
    * > subject leaders focus their teams on a single lesson to be taught the following week
    * > Teachers then write a model answer for the end-of-unit assessment task
      > ...
      > Having been through the steps needed to produce the model answers themselves, teachers are able to give clear and detailed explanations and anticipate where misconceptions arise (Rosenshine, 2010; Coe et al., 2014).
