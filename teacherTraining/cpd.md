Continued Professional Development (CPD)
========================================

Teaching Adults

TASK: What would you do differently when teaching adults


Differences
* Much less contact time
* Do their objectives align with yours

ITT Core Framework
8.1
> Effective professional development is likely to be sustained over time, involve expert support or coaching and opportunities for collaboration.
8.2
> Reflective practice, supported by feedback from and observation of experienced colleagues, professional debate, and learning from educational research, is also likely to support improvement
8.7
> Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve


Background
----------

Education secretary said

> We will have 400 master teachers to deliver the new Computing Curriculum

> Deregulate QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) to let schools employ experts

* [Curse of the expert](https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2013/10/michael-gove-wrong-qualified-teacher-status/)
    * Experts in subject areas does not make them good teachers
* [400 Master Teachers](https://schoolsweek.co.uk/3m-on-and-where-are-all-the-master-teachers/)
    * £3m on and where are all the master teachers?


Master Teachers
---------------

* No allocated time to share practice
* No incentive for schools to donate teacher time
* Experience varied
* No measure of impact

The master teacher program was failed/abandoned


Effective CPD
-------------

Task: Define Effective CPD

One off inspirational speakers are not effective

Story: Theatre troupe. Shakespeare - dark day before the bridge

* Pupil outcomes -> evidence -> evaluation of quality
* Collaboration -> expert
* Sustained -> leadership
* Relevant to learners -> differentiation
* Peer learning -> network


Subject Pedagogy
-----------------

How to teach a subject

PRIMM
    * Predict
    * Run
    * Investigate
    * Modify
    * Make

UMCIII
    * Use
    * Modify
    * Create
    * Imitate
    * Innovate
    * Invent

Read before Write

Pair programming
Growth Mindset
Per investigation/instruction

Programming is hard -> not accurate model -> computer is magic (hope)

Comprehention oriented not creation oriented

Activity: Code Jenga


Impact Evaluation
-----------------

In business we _measure_.
Business define success criteria/targets and then work backwards.
How do we know it has impact? - The measuring is key.

Describe: _Agile Development_ and _Ticket Sizing_


Impact -> Justification -> Plan -> Deliver -> Evaluate


Thomas Guskeys five levels for evaluating CPD
* Participants Reaction
* Participants Learning
* Organization and Support
* Participants use of knowledge/skills
* Student learning outcomes
    * (Start here and work backwards) 'Backwards by design'
* Group input on impact

Senior leaders don't understand Computing
Context on how to apply this to classroom

Constant Evaluation of Impact - Forms
* BD - Before Development
    * Online form
    * Understand expectations
* D1 - During Development
    * Each section of the day
        * Rate usefulness
        * Comments for each section
        * Action points for each section
    * Photocopy after session
* D3
    * ?
* P1 + P2
    * 8 Months after
