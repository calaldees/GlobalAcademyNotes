Keystage 5 - A-Level Computing
==============================

* Objective
    * Understand the structure of the current KS5 syllabus
    * Have the toolkit to develop appropriate class activities that are targeted to the examboard specification.
        * Practical
        * Theory


Your Subject Knowledge
---------------------

You wont be able to get 100% on an A-Level paper. I can't
A-Level is the first year of a degree (All university's teach it all again)
Reassurance: Your Computing skills ARE sufficient for 95% of all your professional interactions.
You CAN do this job.
What you need is the right professional approach.
The students need to know you that you can read/learn/grow.
If you pretend to know it all, you will fall

Time
----

A-Levels take 360 guided learning hours per subject over the duration of the course (normally two years)
4 to 5 Hours a week contact?
A single A-Level year-group is 25% of your fulltime timetable.


History of the A-Level
----------------------

* Pre 2000 - Overlap between ICT and Computing
* 2000-ish
    * AS/A-Level structure was solidified
    * 50% AS - 50% A2
    * AS used to be really easy (because could not rely on previous learning)
    * A2 Practical project (30% of A2 -> 15% of A-Level) - was utterly ridiculous - the jump was too great
* 2008-ish
    * Introduced Nationwide Practical Exam in multiple languages for AS
* 2016 - Spring clean
    * 30% AS - 70% A2
    * AS and A2 Practical Exam
    * A2 Project dramatically reduced/simplified/practical


Courses
-------

* [AQA Computer Science 7516-7517](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517)
    * [spec](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/specifications/AQA-7516-7517-SP-2015.PDF)
* [OCR h046-h446](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/as-and-a-level/computer-science-h046-h446-from-2015/)

Live by the spec.
Give spec to students printed (4 to a page + Duplex) [pages 38-89]

* [AQA/OCR Comparison](https://www.aqa.org.uk/resources/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/plan/aqa-or-ocr)
    * AQA is explicitly clear what is in the spec - practical exam is genuine application
    * OCR Coursework mostly writeup, Theory is vague, little practical, difficult to engage students, resorces locked behind login
