Keystage 5 - A-Level Computing
==============================

* Objective
    * Understand the structure of the current KS5 syllabus
    * Have the toolkit to develop appropriate class activities that are targeted to the examboard specification.
        * Practical
        * Theory


Your Subject Knowledge
---------------------

You wont be able to get 100% on an A-Level paper. I can't
A-Level is the first year of a degree (All university's teach it all again)
Reassurance: Your Computing skills ARE sufficient for 90% of all your professional interactions.
You CAN do this job.
What you need is the right professional approach.
The students need to know you that you can read/learn/grow.
If you pretend to know it all, you will fall.

Discussion:
Teachers are not expected/required to sit the GCSE's and A-Level exams each year along with their students.
Would this be important requirement? would this ongoing feedback be valuable?
Why is a teacher taking exams not common ongoing practice?
On an application for teacher training, why is passing the GCSE in May/June-Session not a requirement?


Time
----

A-Levels take 360 guided learning hours per subject over the duration of the course (normally two years)
4 to 5 Hours a week contact?
A single A-Level year-group is 25% of a teachers full-time timetable.


History of the A-Level
----------------------

* Pre 2000 - Overlap between ICT and Computing as a single subject
* 2000-ish
    * AS/A-Level structure was solidified
        * ICT (aka Office Studies) was split into a separate subject
    * 50% AS - 50% A2
    * AS used to be really easy (because could not rely on previous learning)
    * A2 Practical project (30% of A2 -> 15% of A-Level) - was utterly ridiculous difficulty - the jump was too great
* 2008-ish
    * Nationwide AS _practical exam_ supporting _multiple languages_ (AQA)
* 2016 - Spring clean
    * 29% AS - 71% A2
    * AS *and* A2 Practical Exam (AQA)
    * A2 Project dramatically reduced/simplified practical (14% of A-Level)


Courses
-------

* [AQA Computer Science 7516-7517](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517)
    * [spec-2015](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/specifications/AQA-7516-7517-SP-2015.PDF)
* [OCR h046-h446](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/as-and-a-level/computer-science-h046-h446-from-2015/)
    * AS[spec-2019](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/170845-specification-accredited-as-level-gce-computer-science-h046.pdf)
    * A2[spec-2019](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/170844-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-computer-science-h446.pdf)

Live by the spec.
Give spec to students printed (4 to a page + Duplex) [pages 38-89]

* [AQA/OCR Comparison](https://www.aqa.org.uk/resources/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/plan/aqa-or-ocr)
    * AQA is explicitly clear what is in the spec - practical exam is genuine application
    * OCR Coursework mostly writeup, Spec theory is vague, little practical, difficult to engage students, resources locked behind login (inaccessible to students)


Course Layout
-------------

* For a Novice Teacher - Exam boards provide support
    * Entire years guidance is provided (teaching with stabilisers on the bike)

* For Experienced Teacher
    * Project Time
        * Give all practical activities at beginning of year (more below)
        * Have project work time (allow them to tackle tasks in any order and self direct)
        * Homework becomes more project time
            * They CANNOT develop enough skill with only classroom time
        * Use this to consult 1-2-1 with each student + monitor + record keep + facilitate pairing (pyramid of support) + coach
    * Bring class together for structured theory
        * Spec bingo! (with dates)
        * Exam question the shit out of them
            * Teach them how to use the spec, passed-papers, examiners report (more below)


AS Practical Activities
-----------------------

Wherever possible use practical to teach theory
Have tasks setup at beginning of year and given to students. These could just be a sentence for an entire project.

* Examples of programming exercises
    * https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf
    * https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/400714-algorithm-challenge-booklet-teachers-guide.docx

TASK: Look at theory spec - define a practical activity for a spec point


Passed Papers (Theory)
----------------------

> Teach a student how to _fish/learn_ and they will _feed/teach_ themselves for the rest of their life

Combine QP (question paper), MS (mark scheme) and WRE (Examiners report)
* [OCR H046-H446](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/as-and-a-level/computer-science-h046-h446-from-2015/assessment/)
* [AQA 7516-7517](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/assessment-resources)
    * [Spec-2015](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/specifications/AQA-7516-7517-SP-2015.PDF)
* Old
    * AQA-5511-6511 [Spec-2008](https://www.scribd.com/document/94761/AQA-5511-6511-W-SP-08) 2003-2008?

        * [theallpapers.com/papers](http://www.theallpapers.com/papers/AQA/ALevels/Computing%20(2510)/) Are still relevant
        * Know [what's changed](https://www.aqa.org.uk/resources/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/plan/summary-of-changes-knowledge)

TASK: Do a question + Use Mark Scheme + Examiners report

* Suggested classroom use
    * Just say `AQA 2016 AS Jun Paper2 Q6`
        * Students can find it themselves (teach them to setup bookmarks, download, should take them 60 seconds)
            * Don't rename the files (the exam board named them that way for a reason)
    * Use them as starters/plenary
        * You can set the same question multiple times over the year, (interleaving)
            * Helps reinforce learning
            * If it's a previous topic - spacing and interleaving topics is proven to be an effective leaning technique
    * Use them as homework (to then accelerate a starter?)
    * Every lesson should have one
        * Repeat the QP->MS->ER again and again and again


AS -> A2 Progression
--------------------

You *will* need to use multiple languages
* ObjectOrientation (describes Java)
* Functional programming (Haskell)

* SQL
* REST Server - API JSON/XML
    * Example Task: Generate RSS-feed and json from twitter


Keystage 5 - A-Level Computing - Part 2
=======================================

TASK: Tell me about A-Level Computing ...

* Objective
    * To understand practical assessment for for AQA AS examination
    * Explore A2 Theory Topics with practical programming examples
        * Object Oriented
        * Functional Programming
    * Consider taking Computing beyond the classroom


Passed Papers (Practical)
-------------------------

AQA Paper 1 - Practical
Pre Release -> Exam

* AQA Paper 1
    * Warmup question `AQA 2016 Jun Paper1 Q5` (use the language_cheat_sheet)
    * Specimen - PreRelease Task
    * [AQA Assessment resources](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/assessment-resources)
        * [Paper 1: Specimen preliminary material](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-75171-SPM.PDF)
        * [Paper 1 - Specimen skeleton programs (A-level): Text files](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-75171-SSP.ZIP)

TASK: Monster task - what could they ask? - Define training tasks for students - Fire up program (python?)

The quality of the code written by the exam-board is awful - however!
* The exam-board need to keep the same structure/principles across multiple languages so the questions can be consistent
* The code quality of the code that professional programers work with throughout their career is often of poor quality
    * Good programmers can work-with/understand/improve bad code

AQA Module Weight
-----------------

Always be clear about the weight of each module. Check the spec.

* AS == 29% of A-Level grade
    * 14% Paper 1 - Practical Assessment
    * 14% Paper 2 - Theory
* A2 == 71% of A-Level grade
    * 28% Paper 1 - Practical Assessment
    * 28% Paper 2 - Theory
    * 15% Non-exam assessment - Project/Investigation
        * Any topic - Individual to student
        * 8% Technical solution
        * 7% Documentation
