Questioning
===========

* [Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1)
    * Look at the strength of evidence for questions

    * narrate, explain, analyse, speculate, imagine, explore, evaluate, discuss, argue, justify, and they ask questionsof their own
    * collective, reciprocal, supportive, cumulative, purposeful 
    * > If an answer does not give rise to a new question from itself, it falls out of the dialogue.
    * > What ultimately counts is the extent to which teaching requires pupils to think, not just report someone elseʼs thinking
    * Computing Context: Evidently social impact of technology. Could we use this to compare different types fo loop? A chain of if statements over data?

Diagnostic/Hinge Questions (2.5 hours)
--------------------------

ITT CCF 4.6
> Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

ITT CCF 3.3
> Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable


TASK: Async - 1 hour
* Read [Oiling the hinges – refining my construction of hinge questions](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2013/11/03/oiling-the-hinges-refining-my-construction-of-hinge-question/)
    * History
* Watch [Diagnostic Questions Pedagogy Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlRJIsZnITs&list=PL7BJ-1MkmUZ90bnxd_e-AsIgIsJEGOkC0&index=1)
    * All videos are 40min in total - You can get the majority of information in the first 30min
* Find/Browse examples of Computing [Diagnostic Questions](https://diagnosticquestions.com/) on the the site

Break: 5min

TASK: Sync 15min?
Discuss with group. 
Your opinions and thoughts.
What topics would this be beneficial for? what topics would this be inappropriate for?
* Topic reminders
    * KS3 [National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)
    * KS4 [AQA Spec](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8520/subject-content)

TASK: Async 45 min
Attempt to devise
* 3 simple standalone diagnostic questions (15 min per question?)
* Extension: Create an additional multi-part diagnostic question

TASK: Sync 30min
* Each member presents diagnostic questions to the group
* The group will commentate on what they think the correct answer is and what misconceptions the incorrect answers are addressing before the presenter reveal the intention

            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 20 seconds
                    * More than this means learner is making multiple steps; hard to pin down specific misconception
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response (without the student needing to explain their process)
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?
