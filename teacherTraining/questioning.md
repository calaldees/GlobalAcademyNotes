### Description

Learning is viewed as something that happens in the mind of each learner.

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge

> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. 
<sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

Constructivist theory, based on the work of Dewey (1938); Piaget (1950) and Bruner (1996) suggests that learning is a cumulative and active process during which the student constructs knowledge and meaning for themselves as they learn, connecting with, and explaining new knowledge in terms of, what they already know

Working with tangible real world objects is a central tenet of Papert’s constructionism (Papert and Harel 1991)


* [Constructivism (philosophy of education)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education))
* Social constructivism
    * [Social constructivism](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/gsi-guide-contents/learning-theory-research/social-constructivism/) Vygotsky 1978
    * [Social Constructivism: Vygotsky’s Theory](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/edpsy/chapter/social-constructivism-vygotskys-theory/)
        * > Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction believing that teachers who take control of the child’s learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005)
        * > Vygotsky did not believe children could reach a higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals
* [Constructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centred learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)
        * Steiner Schools
            * [Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship](https://www.steinerwaldorf.org/)
    * [Finland Will Become The First Country In The World To Get Rid Of All School Subjects](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/goodbye-subjects-finland-taking-revolution-education-step/)
        * [Phenomena based education](http://www.phenomenaleducation.info/change-with-digital.html)
* [Constructivism is not a pedagogy](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/constructivism-is-not-a-pedagogy/) David Daidu
    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all.
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species
* (Tangentially interesting and somewhat related to constructivism) [I would never send my kids to school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school) Piotr Wozniak 2017
    * A grizzled ex-academic that has distanced himself from all formal establishments
      > I no longer care about publishing in peer review journals
    * > Education is based on wrong principles and a wrong design
    * > Kids are not adults in miniature
    * Children should never feel stressed or asked to do anything they do not want

### Competency Based Curriculum

* [Teaching and learning in a competence-based curriculum: the case of four secondary schools in England](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585176.2012.731008?src=recsys&journalCode=rcjo20) Byrne 2013
    * Loss of subject base identity
        * lack of confidence made practitioners less creative
    * Non expert teaching
    * lack of student autonomy - behaviour

* CBIC (my case study) - Competency Based Integrated Curriculum - 2009
    * (I can tell this story in our session)


### Discovery Based Learning

* [Discovery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning#Assisted_vs._unassisted_discovery)
    * > is a technique of inquiry-based learning and is considered a constructivist based approach to education.
      > It is also referred to as problem-based learning, experiential learning and 21st century learning.
    * > A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted.
    * > Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information.
    * > Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past.
    * > Pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes.
    * > The teachers’ role in discovery learning is therefore critical to the success of learning outcomes.

### Collaborative Learning

* EEF [Collaborative Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/collaborative-learning/)
    * > A collaborative (or cooperative) learning approach involves pupils working together on activities or learning tasks in a group small enough for everyone to participate on a collective task that has been clearly assigned.
    * > Pupils need support and practice to work together; it does not happen automatically.
    * > Tasks need to be designed carefully so that working together is effective and efficient, otherwise some pupils will try to work on their own.
    * > overemphasis on competition can cause learners to focus on winning rather than succeeding in their learning.


### Consider the phrase 'Asking not telling'

(Some notes I had and left them here)

* What does this code do?
* How would we find out what it dose?
    * Run it?
* How does it work?
    * Dry run it?
    * More debug output?
* How would we modify it to (new thing)?
    * Slightly different values
* How what additions could we make?
* How can we make those additions?

            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 30 seconds
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response without the student needing to explain
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?

                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

Metacognition
-------------

ITT CCF 4.5
> Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success
ITT CCF 4
> scaffold pupils through meta-cognitive and procedural processes

* EEF [Metacognition and Self-regulated Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/metacognition-and-self-regulated-learning/)
    * [METACOGNITION AND SELF-REGULATED LEARNING - Summary of recommendations](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/Summary_of_recommendations_poster.pdf)

> Evidence suggests the use of ‘metacognitive strategies’ – which get pupils to think about their own learning - can be worth the equivalent of an additional +7 months’ progress when used well.
> However, while the potential impact of these approaches is very high, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, less is known about how to apply them effectively in the classroom.

> metacognitive strategies should be taught in conjunction with specific subject content as pupils find it hard to transfer these generic tips to specific tasks.

* Teachers should support pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Teachers should verbalise their metacognitive thinking (‘What do I know about problems like this? What ways of solving them have I used before?’) as they approach and work through a task.
* dialogue needs to be purposeful, with teachers guiding and supporting the conversation 
* Carefully designed guided practice, with support gradually withdrawn as the pupil becomes proficient, can allow pupils to develop skills and strategies before applying them in independent practice.
* Metacognition shouldn’t be an ‘extra’ task for teachers to do but should be built into their teaching activities

Training our students to think about thinking

TASK: Read (10min)
* [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/) Nancy Chick vanderbilt university
    * > for students to become more metacognitive, they must be taught the concept and its language explicitly (Pintrich, 2002; Tanner, 2012), 
    * > most effective when it is adapted to reflect the specific learning contexts of a specific topic, course, or discipline (Zohar & David, 2009).

Volet described "metacognitive strategies" in teaching and learning as the use of metacognition elements to aid learning, including checking, planning, selecting, monitoring, evaluating and revising.

### Some ideas of mine

* Planning
    * Be clear about your expected inputs and outputs and why
    * Pro: Write your unittests before you start coding
* How will you know the task is complete?
* Assess yourself? peer assessment?
    * Number of lines of code
    * Readability (variable names)
    * Comments
* We are continuing this project next session - How can I prepare for next session?
    * What resources are available to you?
* What was the hardest thing about this project? Why was this the hardest thing? What skills would have helped you if you had had them? How would you have go those skills? What could you do in the next project to improve?

You can tell your students all of these things, but would it be more powerful if you got them to ask themselves the questions first?

We should set time aside to explicitly teach/name/model metacognitive skills

(Adapted from NCCE Outstanding Programming Pedagogies course)

* Recognise
    * Base knowledge and vocabulary for the domain
        * Provide as much information you can about the construct being studied.  
        * This provides opportunities for students to make extended use of constructs knowing how they will develop and become more complex.  
        * Misconceptions can be covered and common problems that are experienced so that students can build resilience, knowing that mistakes and problems they encounter are not uncommon.
* Present
    * Explain a solution to others
        * Display code which extends their current knowledge of a given programming construct.
        * Students are to explain the code to a peer within a given constraint such as number of words, sentences or within a given time.
        * This aids their skills in explain errors that they might come across to teachers and peers, providing a greater focus on the key area for amendment.
        * This skill provides opportunities for students to read code, explore different styles of coding and reinforce their understanding of a construct.
* Relate
    * Understand solution in context of others
        * Students can be directed to different solutions to the same problem, sharing which approach might be best in terms of amount of code, time to develop, complexity and efficiency.  
        * They can take a given solution and adapt it to meet the needs of a next context, further developing their generalisation skills.
* Refactor
    * Redesign a solution for optimisation
        * A new concept, one which will significantly stretch student’s knowledge can be demonstrated or shown so that the next level of understanding can begin with more advanced uses of programming constructs.
        * Often there will be a focus on the effectiveness or efficiency of a solution by considering such alternative techniques.
* Model
    * Illustrate or implement an abstraction of a problem
        * A concept can be provided either in written or diagrammatic form.
        * This enforces the need for students to consider what constructs can be combined to produce algorithms capable of solving the given concept in a manner that is computable.
        * Students benefit from seeing how real life concepts and models can be realised by applying the correct logic in order to develop effective and efficient solutions.
* Implement
    * Put a completed design into code 
        * Provide partially completed or abstracted designs or provide a written or bulleted summary to be translated into code.
        * This provides a challenge where students can feel supported from the ‘Know’ elements by constructing suitable algorithms with clear success criteria or requirements.
        * This provides students with the opportunity to focus on logic and syntax and develop independence by leaning on their debugging and logic skills.
* Design
    * Devise a solution structure
        * Provide a scenario for students to abstract and produce a design.
        * This could be in the form of a flowchart, pseudo code.
        * This enables students to create mental models, ask good questions in order to devise designs which are efficient and map effectively to programming constructs in the form of algorithms.
* Trace
    * Desk-check a solution
        * Code can be provided with given inputs and students need to predict the output or vice-versa.
        * This provides opportunities for students to read code, get best practice in terms of structure and to build confidence by understanding or predicting logic without the need to be able to write the construct syntactically.
        * This supports their ability to read different styles of coding among their peers and make better plans before implementation.
* Apply
    * Use a solution as a component in a problem
        * Offer a sub-section of code or part of a design for students to devise a solution by applying the construct accordingly.
        * This provides opportunities for students to build larger programs and exploring the depth of constructs in order to develop more complex and modular solutions.
* Debug
    * Both detect and correct flaws in design 
        * Provide opportunities for students to find errors in code or provide two examples and ask which example is free of code errors.
        * Students can also be asked to find one or more logical and syntax errors.
        * This develops their skills in reading code and building their independence so that the can spot and debug their own programs.
        * Students could also sabotage working code in order for their peers to unpick errors and return to working order.
* Adapt
    * Modify a solution for other domains
        * Students can also be provided with a solution for a given domain and adjust the code in order for the logic to remain the same but for the needs of a new scenario to be met.
        * This develops pupils understanding of how programming constructs can be applied to a range of domains and also enables them to identify the strengths of specific constructs through the exploration of examples that pose similar problems.
* Translate
    * Convert from block, text, flowchart, pseudo code and vice-versa
        * Provide examples of designs in pseudo and flowchart form with tasks for students to implement the designs in code and vice-versa.
        * This develops student’s ability to translate different designs and apply and combine programming constructs in line with logical thought.
* Analyse
    * probe the time complexity of a solution
        * Code snippets or algorithms can be given or displayed to students, giving them the opportunity to share their understanding and thoroughly investigate components of a construct or algorithm, decomposing parts.
        * From this, students make greater associations between different constructs and how they can combine effectively to create algorithms.
