Constructivism (2 Hours)
--------------

ITT CCF 4.5
> Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

TASK: Reading/Research (45 min) Async
Here is some suggested reading
Explore the concept of constructivism

Break: 10 min

TASK: Activity Concept (30 min) Async
With this knowledge we are to:
* Construct a concepts for a Computing based lesson activities that could be considered constructivist/discovery based

### Description

Learning is viewed as something that happens in the mind of each learner.

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge

> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. 
<sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

Constructivist theory, based on the work of Dewey (1938); Piaget (1950) and Bruner (1996) suggests that learning is a cumulative and active process during which the student constructs knowledge and meaning for themselves as they learn, connecting with, and explaining new knowledge in terms of, what they already know

Working with tangible real world objects is a central tenet of Papert’s constructionism (Papert and Harel 1991)


* [Constructivism (philosophy of education)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education))
* Social constructivism
    * [Social constructivism](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/gsi-guide-contents/learning-theory-research/social-constructivism/) Vygotsky 1978
    * [Social Constructivism: Vygotsky’s Theory](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/edpsy/chapter/social-constructivism-vygotskys-theory/)
        * > Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction believing that teachers who take control of the child’s learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005)
        * > Vygotsky did not believe children could reach a higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals
* [Constructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centred learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)

    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all.
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species
* (Tangentially interesting and somewhat related to constructivism) [I would never send my kids to school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school) Piotr Wozniak 2017
    * A grizzled ex-academic that has distanced himself from all formal establishments
      > I no longer care about publishing in peer review journals
    * > Education is based on wrong principles and a wrong design
    * > Kids are not adults in miniature
    * Children should never feel stressed or asked to do anything they do not want

### Competency Based Curriculum

* [Teaching and learning in a competence-based curriculum: the case of four secondary schools in England](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585176.2012.731008?src=recsys&journalCode=rcjo20) Byrne 2013
    * Loss of subject base identity
        * lack of confidence made practitioners less creative
    * Non expert teaching
    * lack of student autonomy - behaviour

* CBIC (my case study) - Competency Based Integrated Curriculum - 2009
    * (I can tell this story in our session)


### Discovery Based Learning

* [Discovery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning#Assisted_vs._unassisted_discovery)
    * > is a technique of inquiry-based learning and is considered a constructivist based approach to education.
      > It is also referred to as problem-based learning, experiential learning and 21st century learning.
    * > A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted.
    * > Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information.
    * > Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past.
    * > Pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes.
    * > The teachers’ role in discovery learning is therefore critical to the success of learning outcomes.

### Consider the phrase 'Asking not telling'

(Some notes I had and left them here)

* What does this code do?
* How would we find out what it dose?
    * Run it?
* How does it work?
    * Dry run it?
    * More debug output?
* How would we modify it to (new thing)?
    * Slightly different values
* How what additions could we make?
* How can we make those additions?

            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 30 seconds
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response without the student needing to explain
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

Metacognition
-------------

ITT CCF 4.5
> Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success
ITT CCF 4
> scaffold pupils through meta-cognitive and procedural processes

* EEF [Metacognition and Self-regulated Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/metacognition-and-self-regulated-learning/)
    * [METACOGNITION AND SELF-REGULATED LEARNING - Summary of recommendations](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/Metacognition/Summary_of_recommendations_poster.pdf)

> Evidence suggests the use of ‘metacognitive strategies’ – which get pupils to think about their own learning - can be worth the equivalent of an additional +7 months’ progress when used well.
> However, while the potential impact of these approaches is very high, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, less is known about how to apply them effectively in the classroom.

> metacognitive strategies should be taught in conjunction with specific subject content as pupils find it hard to transfer these generic tips to specific tasks.

* Teachers should support pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Teachers should verbalise their metacognitive thinking (‘What do I know about problems like this? What ways of solving them have I used before?’) as they approach and work through a task.
* dialogue needs to be purposeful, with teachers guiding and supporting the conversation 
* Carefully designed guided practice, with support gradually withdrawn as the pupil becomes proficient, can allow pupils to develop skills and strategies before applying them in independent practice.
* Metacognition shouldn’t be an ‘extra’ task for teachers to do but should be built into their teaching activities

Training our students to think about thinking

TASK: Read (10min)
* [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/) Nancy Chick vanderbilt university
    * > for students to become more metacognitive, they must be taught the concept and its language explicitly (Pintrich, 2002; Tanner, 2012), 
    * > most effective when it is adapted to reflect the specific learning contexts of a specific topic, course, or discipline (Zohar & David, 2009).

Volet described "metacognitive strategies" in teaching and learning as the use of metacognition elements to aid learning, including checking, planning, selecting, monitoring, evaluating and revising.

### Some ideas of mine

* Planning
    * Be clear about your expected inputs and outputs and why
    * Pro: Write your unittests before you start coding
* How will you know the task is complete?
* Assess yourself? peer assessment?
    * Number of lines of code
    * Readability (variable names)
    * Comments
* We are continuing this project next session - How can I prepare for next session?
    * What resources are available to you?
* What was the hardest thing about this project? Why was this the hardest thing? What skills would have helped you if you had had them? How would you have go those skills? What could you do in the next project to improve?

You can tell your students all of these things, but would it be more powerful if you got them to ask themselves the questions first?

We should set time aside to explicitly teach/name/model metacognitive skills

### Notes of my reading (just for reference)
* (poor article - low sample size) [Metacognitive Strategies in Teaching and Learning Computer Programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334452623_Metacognitive_Strategies_in_Teaching_and_Learning_Computer_Programming)
    * > there is a correlation between the metacognitive awareness level of an individual and their academ-ic achievement
    * > Novices are also  identified  as  having  metacognitive  deficiencies  regardless  of their  age.  In  addition,  they  fail  to  reflect  on  what  they have learned
    * > Several studies demonstrated  that  cooperative  learning  involves  metacognitive thoughts 
* (not conclusive) [Evaluating effectiveness of active learning in computer science using metacognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7044226) 2015 mani et al
    * > Metacognitive strategies on the other hand help the student assess whether the goal has been met. In other words a student can use cognitive strategies, as guided by the metacognitive knowledge, till the goal is met




Generative Learning
-------------------

Fiorella & Mayer 2015

> ... look at the process from the other side of the desk. Generative learning considers the learning experience from the point of view not of the teacher, but of the learner. It asks what should they do with instruction ... to really make sense of it and lean in a way that allows them to apply it to new situations in the future
