            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 30 seconds
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response without the student needing to explain
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

                * > Whatever a student chooses, I will know what they were thinking, that they can only have been thinking that, and that there’s nothing else they might have thought of that I’ve missed.
