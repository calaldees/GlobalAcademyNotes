Managing Data
=============

Objective:
* Understand what data is publicly available for schools and how to interpret it.
* Consider how whole schools and departments use data
* Understand a range of practical tools for tracking class progress

* Data is part of your job
    * Should not encompass your whole job

Use of School Data
------------------

[The 6 golden rules of pupil progress data](https://www.tes.com/news/6-golden-rules-pupil-progress-data)

> Used badly, pupil progress data can do more harm than good

1. Focus on assessment first
2. Minimise the time spent collecting and analysing data
3. Don’t lose sight of the wood for the trees
4. Be very careful of over-analysing small data sets
5. Lower the stakes
6. Use data to raise questions rather than draw conclusions

[DfE Blog - Making time to use data effectively](https://teaching.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/01/making-time-to-use-data-effectively/)

> The mechanics of data collection had obscured and overtaken the reason for collecting the data in the first place

> 3 data collection points per student each year. Staff are given one week to input a grade/level and an attitude to learning score per student and the system has been set up to allow data to be inputted from anywhere (home or school to allow flexible working).

Ofsted Reports & Performance Data
---------------------------------

Lessons observations have been proven to be an opinionated unreliable way to inspect schools.
Ofsted now focuses of looking at the schools data and evidence of _real learning_

* Kent _believes_ in choice. 50% of school are ghrama schools. When comparing schools against LEA average is futile. What do you think that does to statistics? Should not affect *Progress8*.
* Schools can have a negative Progress8 and still be classed as _good_


Organisations
-------------

* [Centre for Education and Monitoring](https://www.cem.org/)
    * > CEM is one of the largest and longest established providers of formative assessments for children of all ages, from early years to post 16. CEM’s methods are research-based, evidence driven and market-tested, built on a foundation of non-commercial academic practice.
    * [video](https://www.cem.org/about-us)
    * [YELLIS](https://www.cem.org/yellis)
        * > Yellis gives us a benchmark as to see how our students compare with others of the same age nationally.
* [Fisher Family Trust](https://fft.org.uk/fft/target-setting/)
    * > FFT is a non-profit organisation established in 2001 as part of the Fischer Family Trust. We are focussed on providing accurate and insightful information to schools which enables pupils to achieve their full potential and schools to improve.


Special Purpose Software
------------------------

Some schools employ 3rd party software to help with data management.

* [Alps](https://alps.education/how-alps-works/)

Personal Experience: Most of these systems are flawed at the data capture level. Teacher time and data capture methods are always of secondary importance compared to the graphs that senior leaders can get. Sadly the data is only use ONCE it's captured.


Is data effective?
------------------

> Data can be tortured sufficiently will to confess to anything

Story: Gender gap - school focus (David Daidu)

[Teacher Effects on Student Achievement and Height: A Cautionary Tale](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26480)

> many states and school districts have adopted value-added measures as indicators of teacher job performance. In this paper, we conduct a new test of the validity of value-added models.

Leadership of a school can twist results. In some cases asking teachers to report different levels to parents.
Story: Dale - Raise their grade


Your schools
------------

Task: Ask students to come prepared to talk about the system in use in their school, then they can question each other and compare different methods (encourage critical engagement).


Flightpath
----------

You don't get a say in a students predicted grade. That is set in stone at KS2.

    * [Flightpaths](http://www.andallthat.co.uk/blog/creating-flight-paths-to-replace-levels-year-7-11-the-impact-of-the-new-gcse-grade-descriptors)
    * [Setting us free - ppt](https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=DAA916CB8AB52178&resid=DAA916CB8AB52178%2149526&authkey=AKMNJnkRHgYi9C0&em=2)

* A ‘flightpath’ is basically an indication of whether a particular pupil is on schedule to achieve a particular grade.
* In order to monitor progress the student would typically take regular tests (or complete agreed tasks) which are assessed against agreed criteria.
* Towards the end of a GCSE course these would be GCSE past papers, marked against board mark schemes.
* The outcome of these tests would be a mark.
* This could then be plotted on a graph
    * typically mark on the Y axis and term on the X axis.
    * A trend line can then be followed to the end of the programme and a predicted grade established.
* Ideally the pupil’s marks should follow the trend line through the following terms and the pupil achieves their potential, but we all know that progress is never smooth.
* Some schools have a flight path graph in the front of pupil folders with the pupil plotting their own marks on it.
    * Looks impressive, but I’m not convinced it actually means anything at all!


Is the data helping?
--------------------

* There is a feeling in some schools that all of this monitoring is more about holding teachers to account (and informing performance management decisions) than it is about promoting pupil progress.
* Students may want to use some of this data in their pupil progress bundles, even if they decide not to it is important that they understand their school system and make the most of what it offers.

They could also compare their school systems with the WRG recommendations at:

Workload Reform
---------------

Perception
* Data in your head cannot be quantified or shared
* Data formally on a computer carries more weight than hand written notes
    * (A-Level student complaint parent/teacher meeting)
* Transparency is vital (It's only useful/real if people can see it)

Hard data is what - Quantative
Soft data is why - Qualative
SIMS
Pupil Premium - stigma - wider
Behaviour logs - incomplete?
Flightpaths damaging - pregedise? moral?
Exit cards - from lesson - still kids (do they know shit?)
Data
* something you have to do
* something you use for action
