Managing Data
=============

Objective:
* Understand what data is publicly available for schools and how to interpret it.
* Consider how whole schools and departments use data
* Understand a range of practical tools for tracking class progress


Use of School Data
------------------

[The 6 golden rules of pupil progress data](https://www.tes.com/news/6-golden-rules-pupil-progress-data)

> Used badly, pupil progress data can do more harm than good

1. Focus on assessment first
2. Minimise the time spent collecting and analysing data
3. Don’t lose sight of the wood for the trees
4. Be very careful of over-analysing small data sets
5. Lower the stakes
6. Use data to raise questions rather than draw conclusions

> The mechanics of data collection had obscured and overtaken the reason for collecting the data in the first place

> 3 data collection points per student each year. Staff are given one week to input a grade/level and an attitude to learning score per student and the system has been set up to allow data to be inputted from anywhere (home or school to allow flexible working).

> REMEMBER, the purpose of assessment is to improve standards (of teaching and learning) not merely to measure them.

Ofsted Reports & Performance Data

Activity: Find the Ofsted report for your school
Activity: Compare your school with other local school

Kent _believes_ in choice. 50% of school are ghrama schools. When comparing schools against LEA average is futile. What do you think that does to statistics? Should not affect *Progress8*.


Schools Lie/Manipulate their data
---------------------------------

Management of a school can twist results. In some cases asking teachers to report different levels to parents.
Story: Dale - Raise their grade


Special Purpose Software
------------------------

Some schools employ 3rd party software to help with data management.

Personal Experience: Most of these systems are flawed at the data capture level. Teacher time and data capture methods are always of secondary importance compared to the graphs that senior leaders can get. Sadly the data is only use ONCE it's captured.


General Purpose Software - Publishing Class Tracking/Progress
-------------------------------------------------------------

Perception
* Data in your head cannot be quantified or shared
* Data formally on a computer carries more weight than hand written notes
* Transparency is vital (It's only useful/real if people can see it)

### Google Docs Public/Private View

1. Create new [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/)
2. Add/Rename Sheets
    * `public`
    * `private`
3. Enter Formula on `public` to reference `private`
    * `={private!B1:1000}`
4. `public` -> Tools -> Protect Sheet -> 'Show warning when editing this range'
5. File -> Publish to the web -> Publish content & settings -> `public` + Automatically republish
6. [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) - Shorten the url
    * Signup (free) will allow you to manually name your short links
7. Distribute link to students and parents
