Read this book preview.
When reading; make notes about action points that would affect the planning of your computing lessons.
We will revisit the topic of 'planning lessons' armed with this information.
Many of the topics touched on in the reading will be explored in more detail in the session.


"When I am planning a lesson I will: ..."



Constructivist theory, based on the work of Dewey (1938); Piaget (1950) and Bruner (1996) suggests that learning is a cumulative and active process during which the student constructs knowledge and meaning for themselves as they learn, connecting with, and explaining new knowledge in terms of, what they already know
Working with tangible real world objects is a central tenet of Papert’s constructionism (Papert and Harel 1991)

        * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
            * They should be clear and unambiguous
            * They should test a single skill or concept
            * Students should be able to answer in less than 30 seconds
            * You should learn something from each incorrect response without the student needing to explain
            * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
        * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
            * Support
                * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                * What topic in the curriculum is this?
            * Extension
                * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
        * Get feedback from students as to why they think that is the answer
            * Find the worst 3 answered questions
            * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
            * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                * Where do students go wrong?
                * Why do they go wrong?
                * What are we going to do about it?

Constructivism
--------------

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge


> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. <sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

* [Contructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centered learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)
        * Steiner Schools

    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species

      > I no longer care about publishing in peer review journals
    * > Education is based on wrong principles and a wrong design
    * > Kids are not adults in miniature
    * Children should never feel stressed or asked to do anything they do not want

Cognitive load theory
---------------------

[Cognitive Load Theory and its application in the classroom](https://impact.chartered.college/article/shibli-cognitive-load-theory-classroom/)

> Dylan Wiliam tweeted on 26 January 2017 that he had ‘come to the conclusion Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory is the single most important thing for teachers to know

> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 
>
> The aim should be to move knowledge to long-term memory 
> because when a student is exposed to new material, 
> they can draw on this previous knowledge and the cognitive load is reduced.
>
> However, if subject knowledge is incomplete, 
> the student is unable to fall back on the long-term memory and the working memory becomes overloaded, 
> leading to working memory failures. 

(Gathercole and Alloway, 2007),


[Cognitive Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)

> Gesturing is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking
