[Understanding How we Learn - A visual guide](https://www.learningscientists.org/book) 2018
[visuals by oliver calgary](https://www.olicav.com/#/understanding-how-we-learn/)
Read this book preview.
When reading; make notes about action points that would affect the planning of your computing lessons.
We will revisit the topic of 'planning lessons' armed with this information.
Many of the topics touched on in the reading will be explored in more detail in the session.

TASK: From our reading - Discuss
1. How do we Learn?
2. How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

### My Notes

* Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * Research == good - our intuition is often wrong
    * Old thinking should be challenged
* Chapter 2 - Different Types of Evidence in Education
    * Behavioural psychology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience are experimental disciplines
    * Blogs, books + other - should be consumed critically
* Chapter 3 - Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
    * Reading easy - so must be working
    * Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective
* Chapter 4 - Pervasive Misunderstandings about Learning: How They Arise, and What Can We Do?
    * Many myths - learning styles
    * Shaming people is not a effective way to change minds
* Chapter 5 - Perception
    * Curse of knowledge
* Chapter 6 - Attention
    * Attention is a limited resource
    * Avoid overload
    * Selective focus - switching tasks slow
    * Mind wondering can miss vital information
* Chapter 7 - Memory
    * Not like computer - use == reconstructing == strengthen
    * Not objective - imagination can become memories
    * Short term memory == 30 seconds
    * Once encoded - we rapidly start to forget
* Chapter 8 - Strategies
    * Spacing (interleaving)
    * Elaboration
    * Concrete (real) examples
    * Visuals (dual coding)
    * Retrieval
* Chapter 9 Planning learning
    * Spacing is hard to stick to schedule
* Chapter 10 Developing understanding
    * Elaborate (add features to memory) - 'How' 'Why'
    * Must be connected to pre-existing knowledge
    * Multiple concrete (real) examples
    * Duel coding - images + words
* Chapter 11 Reinforcing learning
    * Act of retrieval strengthens memory
    * Frequent low stakes quizzes
    * Any retrieval practice is good (it feels hard)
    * Avoid 'feel good' learning

### How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

* Test/Quiz == Retrieval == better learning
* Test/Quiz regularly
* Test/Quiz past topics
* Test, Test, Test, Assess, Assess, Assess, Quiz, Quiz, Quiz - use that to plan


Theory to Practice
------------------

All of this theory is useful. To make it have real world application in your teaching, you should always be thinking:

"With this theory ... When I am planning a lesson I will ..."

After each theory chunk, I will ask the question. 
What does this mean for your computing planning?
We will use breakout rooms of 2/3 for you to quickly discuss what actions you will take when planning a lesson.


Old Theories 
------------

* Understanding How We Learn - Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * From pre reading - 
    * > Teacher-training textbooks and courses sometimes propagate misunderstandings about learning 
    *  Dr Yana Weinstein and Dr Megan Sumeracki 2018
    * [Dual Coding and Learning Styles](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2019/6/6-1) - learning styles not effective
        * > Dual coding and learning styles sound similar, but are not quite the same thing. 
            > While dual coding has scientific evidence backing its use, 
            > learning styles has been repeatedly tested and shown not to improve learning.
* Video [Howard Gardner on Multiple Intelligences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgO8jZTFuQ) Gardener 1997
    * In 20 years - education has moved on. The idea that _individuals learn in different ways_ has largely been debunked. Much more is now known about the way we encode, chunk and schema knowledge.

Cognitive load theory
---------------------

[Cognitive Load Theory and its application in the classroom](https://impact.chartered.college/article/shibli-cognitive-load-theory-classroom/) Chartered College of Teaching Journal 2020

> Dylan Wiliam tweeted on 26 January 2017 that he had ‘come to the conclusion Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory is the single most important thing for teachers to know

Attention is a finite resource and can be depleted quickly.

> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 
>
> The aim should be to move knowledge to long-term memory 
> because when a student is exposed to new material, 
> they can draw on this previous knowledge and the cognitive load is reduced.
>
> However, if subject knowledge is incomplete, 
> the student is unable to fall back on the long-term memory and the working memory becomes overloaded, 
> leading to working memory failures. 
(Gathercole and Alloway, 2007),

> Be wary of reducing cognitive load too much – the learning process should be manageable, but not overly fragmented.

[Cognitive Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load)

> Gesturing is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking

Help sheets or Knowledge Organisers can help reduce cognitive load

Liminal Space
-------------

* [Learning in the Liminal Space: a Semiotic Approach to Threshold Concepts](http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13381/1/13381.pdf) 2014 Ray Land et al
    * [Threshold Concepts in Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Threshold-Concepts-Practice-Educational-Futures/dp/9463005102/) 2016
    * > These conceptual gateways are integrative, exposing the previously hidden interrelatedness of ideas, and are irreversible.
      > However they frequently present troublesome knowledge and are often points at which students become stuck. 
      > Difficulty in understanding may leave the learner in a 'liminal' state of transition, a 'betwixt and between' space of knowing and not knowing, where understanding can approximate to a form of mimicry.
      > Learners navigating such spaces report a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox, anxiety, even chaos
* Forgetting is normal - Liminal space is normal - reassure them it is normal
* Don't rush to students to 'make it right' let them grapple with the problem

* Example
    * Threshold concepts
        * If statements
        * For loops
        * Variables
    * Once we understand those threshold concepts, we can move on to Algorithms

Knowledge Organisers
--------------------

* [Organising knowledge: The purpose and pedagogy of knowledge organisers](https://impact.chartered.college/article/organising-knowledge-purpose-pedagogy-knowledge-organisers/) MARK MILLER September 2018 [BlackBoard pdf](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2681383-dt-content-rid-4010508_1/xid-4010508_1)
    * > A knowledge organiser (KO) sets out the important, useful and powerful knowledge on a topic on a single page (Kirby, 2015). With the content demands of new courses, and schools adopting a knowledge-based curriculum, these are becoming increasingly popular in schools
* [Improved Results & Workload with Knowledge Organisers](https://blog.teamsatchel.com/case-study-improving-results-and-reducing-workloads-with-knowledge-organisers-and-quizzes)
    * > “My students just keep forgetting everything - even though I’ve taught it to them over and over again!”
    * > Knowledge Organisers are an increasingly popular teaching method in schools and simply involve distilling the key information for a term’s teaching, or a topic, onto 1 side of A4 – similar to a graphic organiser.
      > This Knowledge Organiser is given to students as homework on Show My Homework with instructions for students and parents on how the students can test themselves, and how the parents can test their children, to memorise as much of the key information as possible.
* [Are knowledge organisers flawed?](https://learningspy.co.uk/psychology/are-knowledge-organisers-flawed/)
    * > most schools don’t have self-quizzing cultures built in. Students don’t use them effectively and just copy words across blindly without self-quizzing.
      > Worse than that, the KO’s are just stuck into students’ books (or reside at the bottom of their bags) and are never looked at again. 
      > This is a waste of time, but it certainly doesn’t mean that KOs are a bad idea. All it means is that – like everything else – inventions work best when resources, practice and purpose are aligned.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

* Knowledge is always built on previous knowledge
    * As a teacher - if you are aware of the actual previous knowledge (and not just because _you've covered_ it) you can create meaningful sequence
* As a learner - If you're not aware of your knowledge gaps, you assume you don't have them
    * Recall and Evaluation are key
* Train students to check their own knowledge and train them to check each others knowledge
* Idea: Ask students to 'Describe a concept with a picture/diagram/visual'. great retrieval practice

Constructivism
--------------

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge

> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. <sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

Constructivist theory, based on the work of Dewey (1938); Piaget (1950) and Bruner (1996) suggests that learning is a cumulative and active process during which the student constructs knowledge and meaning for themselves as they learn, connecting with, and explaining new knowledge in terms of, what they already know

Working with tangible real world objects is a central tenet of Papert’s constructionism (Papert and Harel 1991)


* [Constructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centred learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)
        * Steiner Schools

* [Constructivism is not a pedagogy](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/constructivism-is-not-a-pedagogy/) David Daidu
    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all.
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species

* [I would never send my kids to school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school) Piotr Wozniak 2017
    * A grizzled ex-academic that has distanced himself from all formal establishments
      > I no longer care about publishing in peer review journals
    * > Education is based on wrong principles and a wrong design
    * > Kids are not adults in miniature
    * Children should never feel stressed or asked to do anything they do not want

### My Case study CBIC

* CBIC (my case study) - Competency Based Integrated Curriculum
* [Teaching and learning in a competence-based curriculum: the case of four secondary schools in England](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585176.2012.731008?src=recsys&journalCode=rcjo20) Byrne 2013
    * Loss of subject base identity
        * lack of confidence made practitioners less creative
    * Non expert teaching
    * lack of student autonomy - behaviour


Discovery Based Learning
------------------------

* [Discovery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning#Assisted_vs._unassisted_discovery)
    * > is a technique of inquiry-based learning and is considered a constructivist based approach to education. 
      > It is also referred to as problem-based learning, experiential learning and 21st century learning
    * > A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted
    * > Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information
    * > Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past
    * > pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes
    * > The teachers’ role in discovery learning is therefore critical to the success of learning outcomes.
