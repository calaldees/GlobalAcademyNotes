This module has two Summative Assessments: 

1. Authentic Practice Recording - (30%) - 15 minutes - due before 14:00 on 3 February 2021

15-minutes of yourself facilitating learning in an authentic context with interaction from learners. Must demonstrate (i) inclusive practice, (ii) engagement of learners in active learning, and (iii) some form of effective inbuilt evaluation of practice. If you are working in a classroom setting, please record this session using Recap and submit the link to your chosen 15-minutes on the template via Turnitin. If you are teaching online, please record your session in Blackboard collaborate and submit the link to your chosen 15-minutes on the template via Turnitin.

2. Written or recorded reflection on practice - (70%) - 2,500-words  or  a 25-minute recorded oral presentation - due before 14:00 on 3 February 2021     

A critical reflection on your teaching and/or support of learning in the light of reflecting on learning from (i) microteaching (ii) a teaching observation by a peer or mentor, (iii) my authentic practice (iv) theory and/or scholarship on teaching. Please include a completed observation form in your appendix. This will not be counted in the wordcount for the assignment. Thus any direct points you wish to make about the observation must be contained within the wordcount/time of the reflection.


The length of your claim can vary by minus or plus 10%. If it is longer than 110%, the University penalty system will apply.No appendices are allowed.

* The reflection is a first-person critical narrative comprising of
    * a brief introduction in which you explain your current role and responsibilities relating in 
        * teaching and/or supporting learning in HE, 
        * its context, 
        * what specific themes of reflection you have chosen for the assignment and why
    * two or three themes of reflection of your choice provided they comply with the learning outcomes and UKPSF D1 requirements below. 
        * You may use some of the reflections that you put down in your reflective logs.
        * It should be a synoptic reflection and critical evaluation of what you have learnt about teaching practice in your own subject discipline or professional service area, 
        * and how you are developing and monitoring your own teaching and support of learners in the light of this.
    * a brief conclusion in which you 
        * summarise your achievements 
        * and address future challenges 
        * and the CPD that you will want to follow

* Level Descriptors
    * D1 - Associate Fellow
        1. Successful engagement with at least two of the five Areas of Activity
            * Your reflection must focus on at least two areas of activities, which would have been chosen in consultation with your peers, mentor and module leader. 
            * You may choose to focus on more than two areas of activity if you wish, but do ensure that two at least are critically engaged with. 
            * The choice of As will depend partly on your role, and you should refer to the UKPSF further guidance on Blackboard to help you make your choice. 
            * A3 is not really scrutinised in the IFL module, but all of the other As are potentially good choices given your role and context.
        2. Successful engagement in appropriate teaching and practices related to these Areas of Activity
            * The practices reflected on must be, amongst other things, based on your observations of authentic practices
        3. Appropriate Core Knowledge and understanding of at least K1 and K2
            * K1 and K2 must be discussed in your reflections, but other Ks can also be incorporated as your practice allows.
        4. A commitment to appropriateProfessional Values in facilitating others’ learning
            * Professional Values V1, V2 and V3 are covered in the IFL module, especially the areas of inclusivity and closing the attainment gap of BAME students, and the CCCU’s widening participation key priority. It is therefore anticipated that you will engage with these in your reflections, but other dimensions relating to these agendas are also possible.
        5. Relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the above activities
            * You must make use of some of the research and scholarship discussed in the module and available on the Blackboard. Other resources can also be used
        6. Successful engagement, where appropriate, in professional development activity related to teaching, learning and assessment responsibilities
            * In addition to your engagement with this module, you need to reflect on at least one other element of CPD that you have taken part of in the past year, and one that you are intending to take part in.


1. Focus of assignment (D1.i-vi)
    * Pass
        * D1 Descriptor is acknowledged and reflected upon in the work.  You show some awareness of the issues involved and discernible relationships between the descriptor and applications to your own practice. You provide conclusions but do not explicitly spell out how you've reached them.
    * Merit
        * Critical reflection on the D1 descriptor in relation to your own practice.  Some relevant issues are identified but either the range is rather narrow or issues are introduced but not explored in detail. You dealing with some of the issues raised and provide convincing conclusions which are clearly related to the objectives of the assignment.	
    * Distinction
        * Critical reflection on the D1 descriptor in relation to your own practice.  An appropriate range of relevant issues identified and distinctive approach taken in dealing with them.  Conclusions are clearly related to objectives of the assignment and the work shows some originality.
2. Evaluation of practice (D1.i-vi)
    * Pass
        * The work contains some evaluation of your practice against broadly defined criteria for effectiveness. The outcomes from your evaluation, and their implications for your future practice are discussed briefly or partially.
    * Merit
        * The work contains evaluation of your practice with clearly defined aims and criteria and the evaluation is based on evidence from at least two sources or perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports). The outcomes from your evaluation and their implications are discussed only in the context of your individual practice. 
    * Distinction
        * In the work you evaluate your practice using evidence from a range of sources and perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports). You clearly define the aims and criteria of the evaluation, and key measures indicating success. You justify these in relation to past or future challenges in your practice. You discuss the outcomes from your evaluation and their implications for your practice across multiple domains (e.g. departmental, disciplinary, institutional and/or sector-wide implications).
3. Reflection and application to your own practice (D1.ii and vi)
    * Pass
        * You share examples from your practice in the work. While they may briefly link theory and research to practice, this reflection is not sustained and/or is not explicitly focused on improving your practice.
    * Merit
        * You share relevant examples from your practice throughout the work and link them to relevant theory or research. However, this reflection on your own practice does not draw together examples to make a sustained case for improvement. 
    * Distinction
        * Throughout the work you analyse relevant, detailed and specific examples from your practice in the light of educational research and theory. This reflection on your practice provides a clear vision and basis of evidence for improving your practice.
4. 
    * Pass
        * The work engages with core readings or scholarship from the programme. It shows evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
    * Merit
        * The work engages with research and scholarship beyond the core module readings and accurately communicates issues implicit in these sources. It shows good evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
    * Distinction
        * The work engages with a wide range of research and scholarship, including disciplinary pedagogies or scholarly debates within educational research. It shows very good evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
5. Quality of academic communication
    * Pass
        * The work meets at least 4 of the sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor), including consistency of referencing. It meets threshold standards for academic writing at level 7. References are accurate but do not exceed the minimum or go beyond the core module readings
    * Merit
        * The work meets at least 5 of the sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor) and is a good example of writing at level 7. References are accurate and exceed the minimum.
    * Distinction
        * The work meets all six sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor) and is exemplary for academic writing at level 7. The references are accurate and exceed the minimum; they demonstrate significant and up-to-date breadth of literature review (including referring to some relevant scholarship within the writer's discipline).

Notes for observers:
Accessibility – were the learning materials (PowerPoint, handouts, equipment etc) and tasks able to be accessed by all students, including those with sensory or physical impairments?  Where necessary, were reasonable adjustments made?  Were recent accessibility requirements met?
Cultural environment – equal opportunity to express their views and were their views treated with respect by the tutor and peers?

Strategies to promote ‘active’ learning
students largely adopting a passive role?
opportunities for discussion, debate, experimentation, peer interaction, problem-solving, and other active learning opportunities? 
Were the learning outcomes clearly stated at the outset, and what strategies did the tutor use to assess learning during and at the end of the session?
Effective checking for learning and evaluation methods
Did the tutor design activities or checks for learning that enabled them to evaluate their students learning?
This could be by promoting active learning strategies and managing the classroom so that all students participate and thus demonstrate their learning and knowledge.
Did they use a tool that checks knowledge in such a way that all students could take part?

How was the session evaluated?
This could range from asking students if the session allowed them to meet the learning outcomes and what they need in the next session (though the checking of learning should largely inform this too), to more formal use of evaluation feedback forms.
How are students being given a voice?
