Introduction
------------

This is a first-person critical reflection to demonstrate my progress towards the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF 2011). I have recently started in the role of _Lecturer in Education of Computing_ at Canterbury Christ Church University. My role is to support trainee teachers in their first year of secondary school teaching. I am responsible for designing/delivering subject pedagogy sessions and providing ongoing support to mentors that support trainees in school placements.

The concept of _teaching teachers_ is a very meta concept. The skills involved in teaching are often considered higher order skills (Bloom 1964). The skills of a teacher can be normally assessed through evidence of their classroom teaching. This term (September 2020 to December 2020) has been challenging because of the global pandemic. All teaching has been mandated to be remote. My trainees first entered their school placements on 16th November. This has restricted the normal practical learning opportunities. The remote situation has also lead to high tensions, anxiety and emotional distance.

My reflections will focus on inclusion and interactions with remote learners in the context of teacher training. Teacher training courses have a wide variety of trainee diversity. Trainees could be fresh graduate with no industry experience though to late career changers. It is well documented that career changers have differing learning needs (Smardar et-al 2020, Troesch and Bauer 2017, Bullough 1990, Furlong & Maynard 2012).

The focus of my reflections will be on the following professional areas of activity:
* (UKPSF-A2) Teach and/or support learning
* (UKPSF-A4) Develop effective learning environments and approaches to student support and guidance

The key measures I will be looking to analyse in my teaching are 'student emotional engagement'. Do my learners feel safe and secure in their ability to progress as learners.

I collected information from lesson observations, anonymous feedback forms, external organisations, professional standards documentation and scholarship. A subset of this material is reflected upon in this write-up.


Micro-teach - Diagnostic questions
----------------------------------

micro-teaching is a 15 minuets teaching activity delivered to peers. We demonstrate our knowledge of teaching practice into a compressed timespan. I delivered an introduction to the concept of "Diagnostic Questions", a teaching technique currently under review by the Education Endowment Foundation. An "incorrect answer" to a question should unveil the students misconception.

It was pointed out that I did not solicit any input from my session for the first 8min. Teaching requires constant attention to soliciting response and engagement, especially online. Being an on-line learner and being "talked at" is not an engaging experience. 

The micro-teach has challenged my thinking about the frequency I interact with my learners online. I must improve my regular explicit checking of understanding. Face-to-face I can read facial expressions and body language and feel more open to asking questions. When teaching online I need to explicitly check the understanding of my students more.

Dylan Wiliam, a professor of education specialising in formative assessment, has an interesting technique for soliciting ongoing feedback from the class with 'traffic light' coloured cups on desks. Green for "I'm ok", "amber for this is tricky" and red for "I'm lost, stop, help" (Wiliam 2011). 

The online platform Blackboard Collaborate supports a similar concept. The UI to control the feedback states are fairly hidden. Once applied the state is transient and vanishes after 30 seconds. There is no log of the state change. Maybe it is worth investing time in directing my students to become familiar with those interface options? or investigate an alternate way of soliciting ongoing feedback from online sessions.

I was surprised when some learners did not understand the concept of _Diagnostic Questions_. This was relayed to me in the chat and some of the task responses missed the concept. I was expecting masters level learners to grasp the concept quickly. Was there a baseline level of understanding that I missed? Was my explanation not clear enough? Was this an artefact of my teaching? or the restrictions of the compressed format of microteaching?

The feedback I received from the students indicated the difficulty of understanding the concept in the compressed time frame:

> I struggled to grasp the concept within the time frame you set for the task.

> spend a bit more time at the beginning to ‘set the stage’. I was not sure what you meant by the term ‘diagnostic questions’ 

These comments alerting me to what the issue but did not help me immediately make the jump to understand _why_ this had happened or what the solution could be. One solution was 'spend more time' on the the topic.

My module lead responded with the following feedback:
> from my perspective the task was ambitious in terms of Bloom's taxonomy, asking us to go straight to the highest level thinking skill with 'create' solo with a concept we'd only just been introduced to

Upon reflection I was not considering the Cognitive Load of the task I had set (Sweller, 1998) (ukpsf-k3). I was requiring students to understand the concept of diagnostic questions and additionally deeply delve into their own subject domains. I could have scaffolded the learning by asking the learners to create a diagnostic question for a known simpler domain, maybe I could have provided a constrained Maths concept and asked pairs to create the diagnostic question.

Teaching competent adults (however qualified) still feel vulnerable when placed in the role of the learner.

> Presenting my mistake in ‘not grasping the concept’ in the chat bar was difficult for me to feedback.

This reinforces Dylan Wiliam's observation of the importance of 'low stakes' assessment (Wiliam 2011).


Critical Incident
-----------------

I encountered a significant critical incident in my teaching practice. I have leveraging Tripp's "critical incidents in teaching cycle" to reflect on the incident (Tripp 1993).

Very early on in my teacher training group, one individual was having difficulty integrating with the course. He was an older career changer. His elitist aggressive tone aggravated and alienated his peers and created ongoing friction with me. He parted ways from the rest of his peers by leaving their informal WhatsApp support group. This behaviour was also identified by other more experienced colleges teaching other modules. His interactions culminated in an incident where others in the group were having difficulty in remote breakout sessions and facilitating group dialogue. He made the claim that he felt "unsafe" in my sessions and aggressively demanded that action should be taken immediately via email. This was difficult to marshal while delivering a live session. I called upon senior colleges to assist and support. 

One of the comments this student raised about me was that "Allan portrayed himself as a sage that had complete control of our course and this caused the group to be cautious about contributing"

> The learning community should provide a safe space for challenge and transformation
(CCCU - Learning and Teaching Strategy - 2015)

I attempted to dissect the events that lead up to this. Consulting further scholarship and using Brockfield's lenses (Brockfield 1995) to consider the view from the learners perspective.

In the opening session of the course I described my role. I was the _glue_ for the course. I liaise with mentors in their placement school, I mark the formal subject pedagogy assignments, I write student references at the end of the year, I perform the intermediary professional reviews throughout the year, I monitor engagement and contributions in subject sessions and relay progress to other professionals as needed. I also used the term _formative assessment_. 

Through the lens of the career changer this could be perceived as a threat. I was younger than the student, I apparently had complete control. I used the scary term 'assessment' and the student was probably unaware of the terminology of 'formative assessment'. The student rightly or wrongly became defensive and aggressive in their further communication.

Wiliam, who coined the term 'formative assessment', identifies that the term is often misconstrued:
> The big mistake that Paul and I made was calling this stuff "assessment"… because when you use the word assessment, people think about tests and exams’ (Stewart, 2012). He later commented that it should probably have been called something like ‘responsive teaching’ (Wiliam, 2013b).

As highlighted by the comment a student made in my micro-teach session. Students need a 'low stakes' environment in order to feel safe in their learning. (Wiliam 2011)

The challenges career changes face when training to teach has been well documented (Smardar et-al 2020, Troesch and Bauer 2017, Bullough 1990, Furlong & Maynard 2012). The DfE has setup support organisations like nowteach.org.uk, 'Now Teach' provides a route for people with significant life experience to successfully become teachers and stay in the sector for the long-term. I consulted with 'Now Teach' staff while reintegrating this student into my sessions.

The way this student was communicating was not in-line with part 2 of the DfE teaching standards "personal and professional conduct". And this was addressed in the reintegration meetings.

As higher education professionals we must respect individual learners and the diverse backgrounds they may come from. Career changes have specific needs. It is important that there is opportunity for learners of all types and that their individual needs are addressed. Higher education (especially teacher training) operates in a wider societal context. We need to instil the professional values of clean, clear, unbiased communication as highlighted by DfE Teacher Standards, CCCU Learning and Teaching Strategy (ukpsf-v1-v3-v4).

Next year I will attempt to clearly convey the support and underlying principles of our higher education institution. I will try to pre-empt and alleviate the panic and fear that comes with such a demanding and daunting course. If I can clearly convey our underlying motivations and instil trust from all students at an early stage, that will lead to better teaching and learning environment (ukpsf-a4).


Authentic Practice - Diagram tooling
------------------------------------

Building upon my microteaching experience, I designed a 25min teaching activity to introduce my teacher training group to tooling that could help them create formal computer science diagram notation. A video recording of this session was submitted as part of this module. (ukpsf-a1-a2)

My session started by listing 6 types of formal Computer Science diagram notations with links to various examples. I took a poll of how many of these diagram types have they heard of. I was not asking for mastery, just an awareness. The results I got back were disheartening. Only one student had heard of them all, some said 'none' and most identified one diagram type. Many of these diagrams are used on the GCSE textbook and all of them are required for A-Level (DfE Teacher Standards; standard 3 - Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge). This is a recurring pattern. I am supposed to be conveying Computing subject pedagogy but find that the groups foundations of Computing subject knowledge is a barrier to learning. (ukpsf-a3)

This experience has prompted me to allocate time and actively convey the knowledge requirements of the discipline. I have a subject knowledge audit tracker that the students use to track their knowledge throughout the year. This tracker currently does not have a section for formal diagram notation. I will audit the GCSE and A-Level course specifications and identify common themes that may need to be added to this audit tracker. At the beginning of the course I recommend students undertake a GCSE paper and work through the mark scheme. I should make this activity mandatory. This should highlight to the trainee the gaps in their subject knowledge. This formative assessment needs to be conducted in a safe 'low stakes' way. Students must not feel embarrassed by their scores or pressured. This could lead to panic and aggression (see critical incident reflection).

At the end of the session I asked if the students felt this 'Diagram Tooling' was a worthwhile skill-set. The responses were less than enthusiastic with multiple members preferring their existing skill-set of using simpler generic tools. I am an experienced practitioner that has created countless exam style questions and handouts. I find this tooling an invaluable productivity boost (ukpsf-k1). I'm passionate about these tools and hope that this passion is contagious. The CCCU; Learning and Teaching Strategy states "We encourage the development of a sense of wonder, the quest for knowledge". I want them to feel this enthusiasm for new knowledge.

Through the lens of the learners (Brockfield 1995), they don't currently see the benefits of this technique, to them it feels like an unneeded additional layer of complexity. Again this highlights to me the importance of Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller 1998). The overhead of learning the diagram notation and the added complexity of the diagram tool was too much. The session was still a success; the objective was to understand that _tooling exists_ and it served as an excellent introduction to these diagram types. As the learners become more proficient teachers, I'm sure that they will identify the long winded pattern of manually creating diagrams and be aware of the possible tools available to them.


Observation by a senior colleague
---------------------------------

As part of the IFL module and part of ongoing department QA, a senior colleague observed a remotely delivered session of mine. The 6 hour session was recoded in full. The observer was directed to a 15min segment that portrayed an average/normal practice. (ukpsf-k6)

I was praised for my "clear overview of the material", "clear time frames for the activities", "a good mix of synchronous and asynchronous work" and "inclusion of the numerous hyperlinks also takes students to further reading". The basic mechanics of teaching were solid. I was following the CCCU Policies. (ukpsf-k4)

Two comments stood out as particularly insightful

### Technology for delivery

Rather than separating my lessons into discreet slides/screens, I opt for a continuous stream that I can scroll through. This allows interactivity by allowing me to highlight words as I speak.

>  The highlighting of the text to which you are referring as you lead the session is helpful in focussing the learners on the point you are trying to make. Just a point worth noting however is when it is used too much during your talk, it can be distracting, especially if it jumps around quite a lot.

I must be mindful that consistent fast movements screen-shared online are fatiguing and stressful for the learners.

### Challenging student comments

> The students mention that the primary curriculum offers "mucking about and tinkering"; I am sure that this wasn’t meant offensively, but I just wonder how our primary colleagues would feel about their curriculum being described in this way. Sometime we do need to counter what the students say – even if it isn’t meant how it sounds – just to make the point

With the aggression and friction I have had from some of my students, I have become more passive with challenging them on passing issues. From the CCCU Learning and Teaching Strategy "The learning community should provide a safe space for challenge and transformation". I need to consider strategies for challenging student comments. (ukpsf-a4)


Conclusion
----------

This formal reflection assignment has positively supported my growth as a higher education professional. The UK Professional Standards have helped focus my reflections and enabled me to access a wider range of material to improve my practice. 

I set out to investigate student emotional engagement with my sessions. Two themes emerged: 
1. Even advanced adult learners need careful consideration of cognitive load in order for them to feel confident and comfortable with their progress
2. Students from diverse backgrounds need different types of support to help them feel emotionally settled

There are clear actions that I can start preparing for next years trainees:
1. The first session and first impressions have important ramifications
2. Consider closer attention to assessing students prior subject knowledge and take that into account when taking students through their learning journey

Trainee teachers need a good stable emotional start to their careers to help them in turn have sector wide impact for the roles they will perform in wider society.

I will continue reflecting and seeking CPD to develop my online pedagogy. I am particularly interested in investigating all-class-response systems to engage all learners online.

Notes for observers:
Accessibility – were the learning materials (PowerPoint, handouts, equipment etc) and tasks able to be accessed by all students, including those with sensory or physical impairments?  Where necessary, were reasonable adjustments made?  Were recent accessibility requirements met?
Cultural environment – equal opportunity to express their views and were their views treated with respect by the tutor and peers?

Strategies to promote ‘active’ learning
students largely adopting a passive role?
opportunities for discussion, debate, experimentation, peer interaction, problem-solving, and other active learning opportunities? 
Were the learning outcomes clearly stated at the outset, and what strategies did the tutor use to assess learning during and at the end of the session?
Effective checking for learning and evaluation methods
Did the tutor design activities or checks for learning that enabled them to evaluate their students learning?
This could be by promoting active learning strategies and managing the classroom so that all students participate and thus demonstrate their learning and knowledge.
Did they use a tool that checks knowledge in such a way that all students could take part?

How was the session evaluated?
This could range from asking students if the session allowed them to meet the learning outcomes and what they need in the next session (though the checking of learning should largely inform this too), to more formal use of evaluation feedback forms.
How are students being given a voice?

Remote only - little context for them


--

Your reflections are excellent.
You've clearly engaged with the subject content and have a superb attitude to challenging your own thinking with clearly actionable points.

You made a comment "I am going to make a crap teacher"
That is not true.
I have taught some SHOCKINGLY bad lessons and made many professional blunders, but I was highly reflective and grew with the support of my friends and colleagues over many years.

You are doing the right thing with ensuring you sustainably and incrementally improve your subject knowledge. Ensure that your python work is tracked on your subject knowledge tracker.

I think some of your dates of your reflections needs to be corrected.

Your attitude is mature and determined.
Keep up the good work!

I think your school placement is going to be a very transformative experience for you.

One other question- can you confirm that for the lit review exercise your expectation is that we limit the books/papers/articles to 2 or 3?


There is no 'limit'.

My suggestion was that your argument will probably centre around the points made in 2 or 3 of them.

You will probably have to draw (in a cursory manner) from more. (Maybe between 6 to 10).
It depends on the sources.
10 Books that are all 300 pages each is different from 10 journals that are 5min read each.

You want the reader of your essay to think "This student has explored this topic sufficiently to have an informed opinion"

Hi xx,

> i am really struggling to understand anything. 

Quite a bit to unpack there.

"Understand anything" is very vague.

A core skill you need to develop is identifying/articulating your issue in more detail.
For me, or anyone, (or even yourself) to take the next step, you need to try to describe where you are and what you want to do.

If I was going to answer that question in a blasé way I could just point you at
The C# books on the reading list for the module
https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_2440750_1&course_id=_13357_1&mode=reset
That would not be effective.

The module you are taking require a certain degree of study skills and self efficacy.


> what can i do to improve my knowledge.

Let's see if I can give you some pointers.

1.) Ask a directed question.

Go back though the lessons and workshops for the C# module and find something that you understand.
I know you can create a "Hello World" program and run it from workshop 1. There is a start.
Go though each of the workshop tasks from the very first one in order.
When you come across something you you don't understand, attempt the problem with the best of your ability.

Start an email
Maybe take a screenshot? or copy and paste the complete code into an email.
Say:
"I am trying to x y z"
"I have re-read the lecture slides and tried the examples and I still don't have the answer."
"I think I get x, so I did this ... I don't know how it fits into y. I have no idea what z is and how it relates to x and y"
"I tried searching for y online and found these three links but I didnt undertsn tham and I dont think they are related. I also looked in the course ebook for example. I found the chapter on y, but nothing fits my problem"
(You may find you don't need to send the email because you found the answer yourself)

If I can see, what you trying to attempt, what you tried to do and what you don't understand, I can help you.

Self efficacy is your ability to resolve the issue yourself using the resources you have available.

All the workshop tasks set each week will build the skills to do this.
If you can do 100% of the workshop tasks you will pass the exam.
Go back and systematically nail every single one of those tasks.
Even if you only get through 5 weeks of the 12 week course by the end of module, you will still be able to get some marks in the exam. 5 workshops of understanding is better than 0 workshops of understanding.

If you think that would take too long; you are on a full time course and you have 200 hours allocated to the module.
At university teachers will not prescribe your every task. You need to decide how to use your time.
Your objective is to pass each module.

This leads onto ...

2.) Consider improving your time management
The university know this is 'jump' for some new students and have provided support.
https://blogs.canterbury.ac.uk/ccculearningskills/year-0-1/time-management/
I don't know your home background but you might try and activity where you total up the number of hours spend playing computer games. If you were to half that number of hours and invest that in the foundation programming skills. That is a good investment in time. You are going to reuse those skills throughout your degree.

3.) Do you have a "Personal Academic Tutor"?
https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/current-students/support-services/personal-support/personal-academic-tutor
It might be worth asking for one. They might be able to help do something similar to what I am attempting to do for you now.

They might be able to help you build study skills.


Given how limited my time is, I hope this email points you in the right diction and prompts you to think further about your study skills.

I am happy to answer a directed question.

Now; go kick some code's ass!


Allan

Anonymous student feedback
--------------------------

On 3 dates throughout the term I solicited anonymous feedback from my teacher trainers. These were collected via online forms.

> The topics and views of everyone were taken in to consideration and the use of a the shared Google Doc form which was edited in real-time was a good way of collaborating.

The PGCE students did not start their placements until the end of November. This increased tensions and stress.

> Without being in a school placement much of the course is very difficult to connect with, which for me at least severely hampers the ability to remember the topics.

Recruit?
--------



I feel under pressure to recruit for my course. I have 9 trainees for PGCE/SchoolDirect Computing. This is not currently a financially viable course of the university. We need high quality Computing teachers. All of my trainees receive a £26,000 bursary as Computing is a shortage subject (DfE Initial teacher training bursaries 2020).

### Introduction to C# - Group differentiation

I have been teaching on "Introduction to C#" Module for Computer Science. The course is well prescribed with a series of lectures, workshops and assessments. By the end of the course the students are expected to take a written requirements for a program and create a working solution in code.

The groups are completely mixed ability. Some have coded before. Some have never coded before. Some weaker students did not understand they need to fully secure the knowledge from each session and need to stick in additional time (if needed) to ensure they are ready for the next session. We are now at the point where students need to combine concepts. This has lead to a few of the weaker students being paralysed with how to continue.

This issue should have been identified earlier by both my self and the students. With covid it has been difficult to move around the room and see this visibly. Online assessments have been alerting them to gaps in their knowledge but the students have not actioned these knowledge gaps and I had not engaged individually with them about their marks. I see them sporadically and I feel pressured to deliver prescribed lecture material to keep the group in sync with the rest of the course.

The students were unaware of the demands of the course time allocation and lacked the skills to identify the importance of what they did not know.

They may be measuring their progress by their peers (who are also lacking in skill-set). They may lack an overall understanding of the course progression.

I have managed to arrange the students seating so that I can move more freely. I have taken time out of sessions while the others are working to give individual support to fill in past topics. The students deeply appreciated the individual attention. I have reiterated the demands of university learning and the course aims and given individual topics and past workshops to complete.

In future identifying these students earlier would give them a better chance success. More time needs to be allocated for repeating the expectations of time but also repeating the expectations of expected progress for the students to self identify areas. I will better support students in their transition from school to university learning by teaching them to use formative assessments as an opportunity to assess and develop on their own learning and supporting them in this. I will ask other colleagues teaching on this course for advice on how they identify/handle these progress issues.

> I think groups should be 3+ which would really help convey ideas and give multiple points of view which can then be sifted and key points brought back to the group.

> Overall I am really enjoying the Friday sessions; personally I don't have much to be critical of at this moment in time.

> There needs to be more content to address the fact that us PGCE students do not have any practical experience going on outside of these Friday lessons.

> 80% of the course should be hands on experience so we are effectively only getting 20% of the knowledge we should be so it is much harder to learn from this limited view of teaching as a profession, though not for Allan's want of trying! 
> The content he delivers is good and detailed where it needs to be with plenty of time to discuss any issues the group perceive. Just all falls a bit short without the practical experience.

Overall, how helpful did you find the session in helping you fulfil the advertised intended learning outcomes (please tick the relevant level):
6 * 5 (85.7%)
1 * 4 (14.3%)

Pace of sessions: 80% agreed it was about right
Split of Teacher focus and Peer/Group/Student focus: 100% about right
How happy are you with the quality of the content delivered: 1 to 5 - 60%*4 and 40%*5


Accessibility - markdown

> I found it a bit hard at the beginning to navigate through your presentation because it is such a non-traditional way of visual aid

> I think the use of markdown is wrong when giving lessons. It is less engaging than pp.

I have a ADHD student. They have requested more breaks in sessions.
I have an older student that has alienated themselves for peer support network (they were kicked from WhatsApp group due to condescending/offensive comments) . Integrating them into group discussions is now much harder and I cant use pair work as most students in the group are on edge when working 1-to-1 with them.
To make progress I'm always using groups of 3+


Read reflections and show you care about the student

Support the student - look at wellbeing - identify the root causese. _Identifying_ is the majority of the battle
