Looking at the students reflections is a very powerful experience. I can see the impact of each sessions.
Seeing these reflections highlights how deep there thoughts and analysis are.
It is particularly impressive. This is a postgraduate level course. The students are seasoned thinkers. 
Although they are at the start of their teacher journy, these first steps of reflection are very promising.

I need to follow up some members of the group for reflections.
If they are unable to reflect clearly during this period of relative calm at uni, they may struggle when they hit placements.
I have already identified some students and may consider a personal support plan for some. It would be wise to raise this swiftly with my team.

The biggest upcoming challenge is how I engage with mentors to support the students.
Mentors visits and liaison is a new role for me.
It will be a good opportunity for me to create some powerful learning opportunities for my students.
I am a little intimidated by the experience of the mentors. They are experienced actively practising teachers and experienced mentors.
My hope is that by supporting mentors with the Christ Church documentation it will be an important linchpin in making the course feel more holistic.
I don't need to be the most experienced super tutor, I just need to support the mentors and students in joining the dots.
