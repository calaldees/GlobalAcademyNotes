Types of school
* [UK School Types](https://www.careerteachers.co.uk/blog/uk-school-types)
* [Independent school system in a nutshell](https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/choosing-a-school/independent-schools/uk-independent-schools-explained)


The National Curriculum
-----------------------

* [The National Curriculum: subjects](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/key-stage-3-and-4)
    * Computing is a Foundation subject
    * Academies/Public/Private/Independent don't need to teach computing
* [National Curriculum: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)


Science Vs Engineering
----------------------

* [Computing Science or Engineering? Language](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641367-dt-content-rid-3959384_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Is%20Computer%20Science%20a%20Science%20-%20Denning.pdf) Denning

Friction with Society
---------------------

Is Computing misunderstood?
Has technology corrupted education?

Computing in the curriculum has been criticized for not being relevant for all students.

Preparing students for a future we are unsure of
------------------------------------------------

* [When landlines were considered dangerous - BBC Ideas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/when-landlines-were-considered-dangerous/p08dwnnz)
* > Low level coding jobs will be the first to go. Sysadmin, network architect, computer support. <sub>Rotten STEM</sub>


Access to information
---------------------

We dreamed of a future where everyone had access to information. It would liberate the working class's.

We now have access ubiquitous to high quality information: YouTube, Learn-to-code resources, Wikipedia

Is the average person smarter, better informed, more skilled?
The problem is not _access to information_.

Is secondary education worth it? A child's cognitive ability improves with age. Is that to do with education? or physical growth?


Constructivism
--------------

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge


> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. <sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

* [Contructivist Teaching and Learning](https://saskschoolboards.ca/wp-content/uploads/97-07.htm)
    * At the core of the constructivist classroom, we often find project-based, problem-based or experience-based learning approaches
        * Pupil centered learning
        * project based learning
        * Competency based integrated curriculum (CBIC)
        * Steiner Schools

* [Constructivism is not a pedagogy](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/constructivism-is-not-a-pedagogy/) David Daidu
    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species


History of Computing education in the UK
----------------------------------------

* [Shut down or restart? The way forward for computing in UK schools](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-summary.pdf) 2012 Recommended reforms
* [School ICT to be replaced by computer science programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929) 2012 'Slaves to the interface'
* [Bricklayers to Architects](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641359-dt-content-rid-3959448_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Bricklayers%20to%20Architects%20-%20Jones.pdf) Page 7/8
    *   > We have many individuals who are able to use applications
        > to varying degrees of proficiency (bricklayers) but do we
        > have enough people capable of building the applications and
        > hardware for the next generation of users (architects)? From the
        > UK government’s perspective, we do not produce a sufficient
        > number of programmers and hardware engineers. 
    *   > The future looks to be interesting. Already there are
        > rumblings that there are woefully small numbers of suitable
        > graduates entering CS teacher training. Even if the number were
        > to rise substantially, it would take some years for expertise to be
        > built and suggested syllabi to embed
