Girls in Computing
==================

* [Gender Balance in Computing](https://teachcomputing.org/gender-balance) - Help us find the best ways to encourage young women to study Computer Science
    * > The Gender Balance in Computing (GBIC) research programme is an amazing opportunity to find out what works to encourage girls to develop an interest during their primary and secondary school years, and increase the number of young women who choose to study Computer Science at GCSE and A level.
    * Six different research interventions ,Run across four years, In over 1000 state schools in England

> Here's a thing and apropos of nothing at all... 
> 2019 (most recent data set I could get before Covid madness set in) 
> Students taking Computer Science and Computing Level 3 qualifications (According to DfE) 10,429.  
> My gut feeling is that DfE is only counting A level (doesn't say that explicitly) and there's probably another 10,000 students doing BTEC and Tech levels and whatnot in Computing at level 3.
> 20,000 (ish) people total. 
> Students applying via UCAS for Computing group qualifications 136,070 (according to UCAS). 
> 15.9% female 
> So where do  the other 116,000 applicants come from?
