### Courageous Leadership

You have a duty of care over your students.
I would like to extend that to.
You have a duty of care over your team (this includes your colleges).
Your have some element of control over your teams emotional state.

> Let's all choose to be the leaders we wish we had

* Conduct yourself properly
    * Who would you trust
        * Heart surgeon flapping arms around and shouting 'oh no there is blood everywhere'
        * Heart surgeon calming explaining the breach and asking for the next tool
* Use Precise Language
* Identify problems - Collate solutions - Take action points
    * Prevent cyclic patterns - call them out
* Identify the *spirit* of conversations
    * Students are not _retards_
 


Language
--------

It's shit
They're a prat

What language could we use to relay these?

> I'm disinclined to acquiesce your request.
> It means "No"

<sub>Pirates of the Caribbean</sub>

If you talk like X you will be treated like X

* It takes to long
    * I feel the time I am spending on X is disproportionate
* I can't do it
    * I am struggling with

Don't expect somebody else to fix your shit automatically.
Don't windge.

Process
-------

Business's are living breathing systems.
There are established process's.

Channels of communication

Send an email to headteacher?

Verbal -> Formal Verbal -> Written

Email is a _formal_ means of communication.
It is recorded.
It is evidence.
It is tracked.
* If a large email requires a response and you will take time to respond, respond with a receipt
    *  "Hi, thanks for your email. I will take some time to digest you points and respond towards the end of the week"





What is the process if you are going to be late?


You have induction packs/training. As a member of staff you are expected to know all of it. Ignorance is not an excuse.
Many organisations have 
* online e-learning 
    * You have to tick a box to say I've read this. This means if you break this, it is your fault 
    * 

Is it the _organisations_ fault or _your_ fault?

Personal guide
Poletics and Religion should not be discussed at school
These will likely alienate people

> Normal people communicate to align, nerds communicate to peer review
