Session 1 - How do you learn to teach
=====================================

Induction to programme materials, structure and professional engagement

* AM
    * Christ Church resources, paperwork, course overview, support
* PM
    * General exploration of Computer Science Educaiton


Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My position
Practical battle experience
Weaker on cutting edge research and theory

My own ideas for how to teach computing
* multiple languages at once
* unittests
* pair programming (talking about code and collaborating)
* version control
* Freedom/project based (unsuitable for lower school)

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect

Side-note: Computing students and mindset compared to other subject practicitions that could feel trapped

### Mini survey

Thumb-up-o-meter
* Multiple programming languages (to an autonomous level)
* Version control
* Linux


The Course
----------

> Understand the route through training and education that is prepared for them, and their role in that training and education

From the [CCCU Computer Science Curriculm Guidance]()

> All sessions are designed to develop your pedagogy and have been devised by your University tutors in consultation with mentors from partnership schools that includes input from previous student teachers. 
> Sessions, underpinned by research and theory, will explore a wide range of teaching and learning strategies and resources and identify and make use of a variety of best practice ideologies.

The purpose of this course is to challenge you and challenge your thinking

### Aims and purposes of our teaching and learning

* meta-pedagogy (not _tips for teaching_, not pre-prepared-lessons)
* Tacit knowledge transfer - e.g. Riding Bike, Learning to read
    * Can you write down the steps to ride a bike?
* 10,000 hours
    * How long have you spent driving? Why are you not a world class driver?
    * Reflection/Feedback

TASK: How would you teach someone to ride a bike?
120 seconds - Write down - the phases/notes
Describe verbally to group

* Subject Knowledge
* Pedagogical Knowledge
* Context Knowledge

> Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) conceptualises both the link and the distinction between knowing something for yourself and being able to enable others to know it.

### Your development phases

* Unconscious incompetence
* Concious incompetence
* Concious competence
* Unconscious competence

1. Early idealism
2. Personal survival
3. Dealing with difficulties
4. Hitting a plateau
5. Moving on

### Strands

1. Criticality
    * conflict - alternate view - sources of information
2. Creativity
    * Can we teach concepts of computing with playdough?
3. Inclusion
    * Catering for everybody (not just a subset of society)
4. Subject Knowledge
    * Passion and Skill

### Course Requirements

* Experience teaching 4 year groups
* In 2 Schools
* With 120 Days teaching

With Covid, some of these requirement may not be possible.
This comes down to assessment from your Mentors and your Subject Tutor.

### Assessment

* Teaching Portfolio (physical or digital)
    * Single document to print/reference/archive
    * Lesson plans
    * Lesson observations
    * Examples of pupil work
    * Reflections
* 2 Academic Assignments
    * Subject
    * Active Research + Presentation

### Subject Sessions

Post Covid - Blended Learning - Flipped Learning

Same Course -> New ways of delivery

* Blended learning
    * Traditional: All learning done in the same classroom with the same teacher
    * Blended: The deliberate planning for different methods of delivery
        * Async/Synchronous 
        * Rotating, rooms, labs, equipment, teachers
* Flipped learning
    * Traditional: Lower order knowlege skills in lessons. Higher order skills (like evaluating) done at home
    * Flipped: Lower order knowlege skills at home (async). Higher order evaluation/discussion (sync) in class

![Here's What's Wrong With Bloom's Taxonomy: A Deeper Learning Perspective](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/Blooms%20graphic.png)
> The problem is that both versions present a false vision of learning. 
> Learning is not a hierarchy or a linear process. 
> This graphic gives the mistaken impression that these cognitive processes are discrete, that it's possible to perform one of these skills separately from others. 
> It also gives the mistaken impression that some of these skills are more difficult

![What, why, and how to implement a flipped classroom model](https://omerad.msu.edu/images/teaching/blooms_taxonomy.png)
> In traditional learning, lower level of learning such as remembering and understanding is happening in class, while students are usually left to work on activities that involve higher level of learning outside of classroom.
> However, in the flipped classroom model, learning is flipped. 
> As you can see from the pyramid, students can finish the lower level of cognitive work before class. And when they come to class, they can engage in higher cognitive levels of learning with peers and teacher present.

* 50% of Subject Sessions == On Campus - Face-to-face
    * 6 hours (+1 hour lunch) 9:00 to 16:00
* 50% of Subject Session == Online - Teams/BlackBoardCollaborate

        * Sent 3 hours worth of async reading/videos/investigation
        * Collaboration with async tools - wikis, padlets
    * Friday (Subject Session Days)
        * AM - ad-hock space for 1-to-1 catchup with subject tutor
        * PM - 13:00 to 16:00 BlackBoardCollaborate/MSTeams

### Remote working/learning

#### The bad

* Not the same as face-to-face
* Lack of engagement
* Lack of socialisation and community
* How can you learn to teach if you cant see your students or be in a school?

TASK: What are you concerns?

#### Fall _Up_ (not down)

One Piece - Episode 119 - Secret of Powerful Swordplay!
> Zoro: (is heavily wounded)
>
> Mr1: My body is made of steel. I can turn any part of my body into a blade. You cannot win.
>
> Mr1: Why are you smiling?
>
> Zoro: Because when I finish this fight, I will be a man that can cut steel.

By the end of this year, we will have gained experience with a host of new tools that could have significant impact on our ability to teach more effectively. 

This could be one of the biggest evolutions in education for 100's of years.

### Ways of working (our group)

* How are we (as a group) going to embrace this remote learning?
* How are we going to ensure these session have impact and value for you?

Tools
-----

Use the right tools
do not suffer dataloss
There will be little excuse for you as Computing professionals


### Recording Sessions

* ReCap
    * If we record a 7 hour video
        * This is hard to access/find/seek information
        * It discourages some people to participate because it will be set in stone
    * I will record segments of sessions




Reflective practice
-------------------

* Actions (leaver)
    * Immediate actions
    * Future points (How will you come back to these?)
* Measure impact (how will you know it has had an effect)



* Every session has progress and evidence
    * You come away with actions
    * Reflections are recorded
    * Educator has evidence of progress
        * Record comments on each students input every session
        * Monitor Engagement
        * Every interaction with me is assessed
            * Let's disect this
            * Asking soemthing - not a problem - 
                I will be considering - why are they asking this?
        * Justify choices - last year lockdown - asked to predict on trajectory



* Driving car 10,000 hours

* How we will reflect
    * Tools



My notebook method

Professionalism and conduct
---------------------------

> Identify and understand expectations regarding professionalism and professionality

### Discuss

> Teachers are pillars of society

<sub>Anon</sub>


### Recommendations

* Be punctual
* Do not discuss politics or religion with school colleagues
* Be 100% yourself, but watch your terminology/language
* Be mindfull of ongoing negativity
    * when relaying problems - suggest solutions
    * identify/call-out good progress

### My Role as course tutor (the reality)
* Line manager-esk?
* Every interaction is an assessment
* Records

Some of you may have had a drink in a pub with your line manager at the end of the week. You can be friends. But they are still your line manager. They have the power to invoke disciplinary procedures and formally report progress.

As a result of my role, you need to construct your interactions with me deliberately.

### My Stories
* "Can I call them _monkeys_?"
    * You would have to be supremely confident
* "No you muppet"
* "Dude"
* 6th form letter to head


### Communication

Complaints in the past that communication has been fragmented, late or mistimed
Lots of moving parts
Tutor, School Mentor, Uni Admin, Uni Program Directors, Students, School Admin, PGCE-topup Tutor
I am not on the same email lists as you (This is being discussed/rectified)
Do note panic.
Comunicate concerns clearly
You will not be penalised unduely or unfairly
