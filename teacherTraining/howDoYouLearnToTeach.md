Session 1 - How do you learn to teach
=====================================

Induction to programme materials, structure and professional engagement

* AM

* PM
    * General exploration of Computer Science Educaiton


Introductions
-------------

* Who am I?
* Who are you?

My position
Practical battle experience
Weaker on cutting edge research and theory

My own ideas for how to teach computing
multiple languages at once
unittests
pair programming (talking about code and collaborating)
version control
Freedom/project based (unsuitable for lower school)



Reflective practice
-------------------

* Actions (leaver)
    * Immediate actions
    * Future points (How will you come back to these?)

### Remote working

#### The bad

Not the same as face to face
Lack of engagement
Lack of socialisation and community
How can you learn to teach if you cant see your students or be in a school?

What are you concerns?

#### Fall _Up_ (not down)

One Piece - Episode 119 - Secret of Powerful Swordplay!
> Zoro: (is heavily wounded)
>
> Mr1: My body is made of steel. I can turn any part of my body into a blade. You cannot win.
>
> Mr1: Why are you smiling?
>
> Zoro: Because when I finish this fight, I will be a man that can cut steel.

By the end of this year, we will have gained experience with a host of new tools that could have significant impact on our ability to teach more effectively. 

This could be one of the biggest evolutions in education for 100's of years.


### Ways of working
* How are we (as a group) going to embrace this remote learning?
* How are we going to ensure these session have impact and value for you?

Tools
-----

Use the right tools
do not suffer dataloss
There will be little excuse for you as Computing professionals


### Recording Sessions

* ReCap
    * If we record a 7 hour video
        * This is hard to access/find/seek information
        * It discourages some people to participate because it will be set in stone
    * I will record segments of sessions





Professionalism and conduct
---------------------------

> Identify and understand expectations regarding professionalism and professionality

### Discuss

> Teachers are pillars of society

<sub>Anon</sub>


### Recommendations

* Be punctual
* Do not discuss politics or religion with school colleagues
* Be 100% yourself, but watch your terminology/language

### My Role as course tutor (the reality)
* Line manager-esk?
* Every interaction is an assessment
* Records

Some of you may have had a drink in a pub with your line manager at the end of the week. You can be friends. But they are still your line manager.

As a result of my role, you need to construct your interactions with me deliberately.

### My Stories
* "Can I call them _monkeys_?"
    * You would have to be supremely confident
* "No you muppet"
* "Dude"
* 6th form letter to head


### Communication

Complaints in the past that communication has been fragmented, late or mistimed
Lots of moving parts

I am not on the same email lists as you (This is being discussed/rectified)

Comunicate concerns clearly
You will not be penalised unduely or unfairly
