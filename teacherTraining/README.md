All teaching is subjective. It is dependent on
* Your students
* Your environment (school/curriculum/community/country)
* You (you are not me)

Everything here is a suggestion and example of what has worked in some specific environments in the past.
It is NOT the gospel of how to teach Computing.

In teacher training you are assessed by your mentor who may have many years of experience and their own strategies for teaching. Don't piss in their pool.
