Project Supervision
===================

Notes for supervising a 3rd year agile software development project


Meeting 1
---------

* Setup Git mono repo for code + all documentation
    * Each feature will be a branch
* Markdown
    * Mermaid
* Initial Tickets
    * Description of deliverable functionally
        * Without specifying technical specifics
    * Conditions of Success (COS)
    * List notes/thoughts about technical implementation
    * Ready for sizing

Meeting 2
---------

* Git repo?
    * Check git commands
* Each ticket should do something for the user
    * Tests?
* 19th Feb
    * Introduction chapter
    * References (if appropriate),
    * Bibliography (ifappropriate),
    * Appendix L: Agile Development: Timebox1

    * Overview of scope, purpose and benefit to customer/user.
    * Narrative on problem situation (current situation) to be resolved and functionality to be provided (Mo-SCoW) and how this enhances the situation.
    * General Introduction to the Timebox Outlining: 
        * 1. Prioritised Targets for the timebox.
        * 2. Description of the choice of Software Engineering artefacts to be produced in this stage e.g.
            * UseCases,
            * Personas,
            * UserDescriptions,
            * CRCcards,
            * ERDiagrams,  
            * ClassDiagrams,
            * UIContentDiagrams,
            * DFDs,
            * UIdesigns,
            * StateTransition
            * Net-works,
            * DataDictionaries,
            * DBtabledesigns,
            * ObjectDiagrams,
            * etc
    * Summary of Timebox Activity:
        * 1.Summary of (changes in) this timebox to system – Achievements and missing features.
        * 2.Changes to project plan in the light of development in this timebox.
    * Conclusions:
        * 1. Summary of learning and achievement in this timebox.
        * 2. Reflection on the success of the work in this timebox – alternative actions/devel-opments/techniques and their potential to have improved the delivery.
    * UserGuide,
        * if appropriate – suggest a 
            * [Minimal Manual format](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1207/s15327051hci0302_2) as per Carroll (1987) – NOT just a small user manual
                * [scan-pdf](http://swcarpentry.github.io/swc-releases/2017.02/instructor-training/files/papers/carroll-minimal-manual-1987.pdf) 
        * * [CREATING MINIMALIST INSTRUCTION](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8fd/1192c8936fab12e46cc9eb605e323e30ff52.pdf), 
    * It is important to note that the timebox MUST produce a fully documented and tested system with some useful functionality that the end user can work with.It is not an evolutionary prototyping method, where code can be produced that does not immediately produce useful functionality for the intended user

5	Methodical approach to work/developing a plan of work.
5	Working independently generally and independently of the supervisor.  Is the work substantially the candidate's own work?
5	Using initiative and/or imagination (e.g. in developing the scope of the work), extending familiar concepts and a general understanding of the work (possibly checked at demonstration/s).

5	Introduction: background to the problem, justification for the chosen task, etc., which maybe contained in more than just the Introduction chapter.
15	Phase 1 Development: Initial Hand-in version. Appropriate selection of functionality. Appropriate Analysis and Design Methods chosen, and well used for this phase of development. Appropriate data structures and coding. Good testing of elements in this phase. User Guide, if appropriate.
10	Phase 2 Development: As per Phase 1, plus appropriate re-factoring, when needed. (optionally presented to supervisor, on a date to be arranged).
10	Phase 3 Development: as Per Phase 2 . As presented at the final demonstration.
5	Final deliverable code quality: Good classes or data structures used, consistent coding standards and appropriate secondary notations and commentary used. Code refactoring performed to minimise duplication across development phases.
15	Final deliverable usability. Consistent, minimal and approachable design with close attention paid to user profiles, task requirements and context of use.
15	Final deliverable functionality. How well the system works and meets the requirements for the functionality selection.
5	Final functionality selection. Appropriate prioritisation in MoSCoW ruleset for a useful product given the level of development undertaken.
5	Project management procedures: schedules; monitoring of progress; Audit trail of development, etc.
10	Presentation, organisation and style: quality of English (with few editorial, grammatical or spelling errors); appropriate writing style with due emphasis on formality; relevant use of jargon, technical terms and glossary; physical and logical layout of the  report; formatting; headings/sub-headings; page numbering; binding; table of contents; margins and white space; tables; diagrams; sequencing of chapters/topics; appropriate use of appendices; cross referencing; ease of auditing; appropriate abstract; acknowledgments; quoting and in-text referencing of sources; departmental standards for report layout & presentation; references and bibliographies; etc.
10	Achievement: Generally, and more specifically with respect to meeting the specified  requirements and the requirements detailed in the (amended) PID.
10	Conclusions, critical perspective, evaluation and suggestions for further work.
