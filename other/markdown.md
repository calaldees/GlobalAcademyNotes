Presentation software has been refereed to as _slideware jail_.

> Traditional slideware is hard to proofread, and tweaking text size and alignment on large decks feels like a waste of time.

> ... taking the contents of a single text file (markdown) and turning it into a completely acceptable and usable slide deck.

Quote from [DeckDown](http://deckdown.org/)

Online Document editing tools are also insufficient. We would not have an approval process. This would be damaging once a critical size of collaborators is reached.

We want to create a set of teaching resources that
* Facilitates collaboration
    * Changelog
    * Comments
    * Approval
* Version control
* Use industry software development tooling

We can use Git and Markdown.

If we use MarkDown/SVG to describe our content, there are system for exporting to:
* Slideshows
    * HTML
    * Powerpoint
* PDF's
* Books
* A4 Handouts
* Websites
    * [MdMe](https://github.com/susam/mdme)

There are plugins for Markdown to render
* Mathematical symbols
* UML
* Musical notation (abc)
* MindMaps (to svg and live web)
    * https://markmap.js.org/
* Video ??
    * [VideoPuppet](https://www.videopuppet.com/docs/script/)
