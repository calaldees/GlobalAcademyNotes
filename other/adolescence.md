Adolescence - defined by the scientists as between 10 and 24 - is a vulnerable stage, when young people want to spend more time with their friends than their family, as they prepare for adult life.

Combined with major hormonal and biological changes, it's a key time for the development of the brain.

It's also the period in life when mental-health problems are mostly likely to develop.
