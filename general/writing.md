    * A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 
        * What am I trying to say? 
        * What words will express it? 
        * What image or idiom will make it clearer? 
        * Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? 
        * And he will probably ask himself two more: 
            * Could I put it more shortly? 
            * Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
