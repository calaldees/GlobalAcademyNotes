        1. What is the problem for which technology claims to be the solution?
        2. Who's problem is it (everyone's problem? or elites problem? who will pay for it?)
        3. What new problems might be created once we solve this problem?

            * Antibiotics - reduction of immune system
            * Television - socialising, loss of literacy
        4. Which people and what institutions might be most seriously harmed by a technological solution
        * Luddites 1811->1818 England
            * Skilled manual workers in garment industry - saw what it would do to their children - so they smashed industrial machinery - killed and imprisoned
        * Winners and looser - Bill Gates - Computers will not be harmful to anyone - losers should be unaware they are losers
        * Teachers loose to computers - 100 million dollars project to connect schools to internet
        5. What changes in language are being promoted due to technology
            * Community? tollerance?
        6. What sort of people or institutions acquire power from technical change?
            * Telivision gives power to some - media entrepreneurs are infested in maximising the profits of new media and don't give much thoughts thoughts to the cultural change

        8. Where and how will our citizens going to learn how to challenge media - assigned to our schools - irresponsibly
        * What's going to happen to people that oppose this progress
            * Negotiate with this new world - use the tech that solves a problem
            * Can we maximises the advantages while minimising the disadvantages
        * 1:08:00 even if schools teach absolutely no computers, young people will still know how to use them
        * What's distracting us from solving problems is the mantra "If only we had more information"
            * Humanity always had information scarcity
            * We have never suffered from information overload before
