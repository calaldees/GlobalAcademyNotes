Origins of Life and Celluar mechanisums

    * a chemoton (theory of simplest form of life)
        * A theoretical model for the simplest form of life requires three interlocking mechanisms:
        * a metabolic cycle, for turning food into energy;
        * template replication, for reproduction; 
        * and a membrane, to delineate the organism.
    * autocatalytic set - Kauffman
        * chemical A drives the formation of chemical B, which then drives the formation of chemical C, and so on, until something in the chain makes a fresh version of chemical A. After one cycle, two copies of each set of chemicals will exist. Given sufficient raw materials, another cycle will yield four copies, and continue exponentially.
    * hypercycle - Manfred Eigen 
        * several autocatalytic sets combine to form a single larger one. 
        * In a hypercycle, some of the chemicals are genes and are therefore made of DNA or some other nucleic acid, while others are proteins that are made-to-order based on the information in the genes. This system could evolve based on changes—mutations—in the genes, a function that Kauffman’s model lacked.
    * Gánti had independently
        * two key processes must take place in every living organism. 
            1. it has to build and maintain its body; that is, it needs a metabolism.
            2. it has to have some sort of information storage system, such as a gene or genes, that could be copied and passed on to offspring
        * a journalist who pointed out a key flaw. Gánti assumed the two systems were based on chemicals floating in water. But left to themselves, they would drift apart, and the chemoton would “die.”
        * The only solution was to add a third system: an outer barrier to contain them. In living cells, this barrier is a membrane made of fat-like chemicals called lipids
    *  2003, Jack Szostak of Harvard Medical School and his colleagues have built increasingly lifelike protocells: simple versions of cells containing a range of chemicals. These protocells can grow and divide, meaning they can self-replicate.
    * 2013, Szostak and his then-student Kate Adamala persuaded RNA to copy itself within a protocell.
    * Starting with just six simple chemicals, like water and methane, Szymkuć found it was possible to make tens of thousands of key ingredients, including the basic components of proteins and RNA.
    * “Life is not proteins, life is not RNA, life is not lipid bilayers,” Griesemer says. “What is it? It’s all those things hooked together in the right organization.”
