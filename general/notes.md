    * Note-taking 
        * is fast, uses the original authorâ€™s language, and generally feels easier. 
        * The issue is the content is often poorly assimilated and easily forgotten. 
    * Note-making 
        * is slower, more involved, and uses our own language.
        * As a result, the content is easier to understand and remember.
    * There are three key principles to making good notes:
        * Rephrase the original idea
        * Connect ideas together
        * Build upon the ideas
    * [digital gardening](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) consists in crafting and connecting evergreen notes in a non-hierarchical repository, similar to a personal wiki
