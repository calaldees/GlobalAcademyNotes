Other Languages
===============

* [On repl-driven programming](http://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/)
    * Common Lisp and Smalltalk are repl languages
        * Other languages have something similar
    * repl: read-eval-print loop

* [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org)
    * Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.
