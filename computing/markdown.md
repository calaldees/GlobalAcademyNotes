MarkDown
========

What is MarkDown
----------------

* [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* [Markdown CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/markdown)
* [Basic Github Syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Why use MarkDown
----------------

Presentation software has been refereed to as _slideware jail_.

> Traditional slideware is hard to proofread, and tweaking text size and alignment on large decks feels like a waste of time.

> ... taking the contents of a single text file (markdown) and turning it into a completely acceptable and usable slide deck.

Quote from [DeckDown](http://deckdown.org/)

Online Document editing tools are also insufficient. We would not have an approval process. This would be damaging once a critical size of collaborators is reached.

We want to create a set of teaching resources that
* Version control
    * Changelog (with rollback)
* Facilitates collaboration
    * Comments
    * Approval process (2 people need to approve)
* Use open industry tooling

We can use Git and Markdown.

If we use MarkDown/SVG to describe our content, there are system for exporting to:
* Slideshows
    * HTML
    * Powerpoint
* PDF's
* Books
* A4 Handouts
* Websites
    * [MdMe](https://github.com/susam/mdme)

There are plugins for Markdown to render
* Mathematical symbols
* UML
* Musical notation [abc](http://www.lesession.co.uk/abc/abc_notation.htm)
* MindMaps (to svg and live web)
    * https://markmap.js.org/
* Video ??
    * [VideoPuppet](https://www.videopuppet.com/docs/script/)
