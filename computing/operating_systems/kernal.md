* [Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential](https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html)
    * WSL1 translated linux calls to windows calls and had a single kernal
        * You could see linux process's in the windows process tree
    * WSL2 is just a co-resident kernel (a separate vm)
    * BSD did the translation layer years ago in reverse
