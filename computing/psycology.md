        * Myth 1: Social media  is addictive,  and we are powerless to  resist it
            * > The panic often stems from desires to protect and control others, particularly women  and children, who are seen as uniquely vulnerable to its harmful properties
            > Moral panics often use the language  of addiction to pathologize the thing they fear. 
            > This myth reinforces the narrative that technology design leads to control of millions of users, locating enormous power with a small group  of tech companies
            * "differential  susceptibility" each individual is more/or-less susceptible - this has been the same throughout history
        * Myth 2: Technology  companies can fix the problems they create with better technology.
            * > Technological solutions to social problems seem quicker, cheaper, and simpler to implement than larger  social changes.
        * Myth 3: Growth and  engagement  metrics are  the best drivers  of decision- making at tech companies
            * > What you can measure becomes what you value: it’s easier to measure growth than health and well-being
            * > Many of our most cherished values are not amenable to quantitative measurement
        * Myth 4: Our health and well-being depend on spending less time with screens and social media platforms
            * > “attention extraction economy” is why individuals are unhappy, and why societies are failing.
            * > Health and well-being cannot be reduced to the single variable of screen time.
