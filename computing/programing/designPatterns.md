* [The Grand Unified Theory of Software Architecture](https://danuker.go.ro/the-grand-unified-theory-of-software-architecture.html)
    * Beautifully short illustrative article
    * Summary of 'Clean Code' and 'thin imperative shell around a functional core'

* [John Carmack on Inlined Code](http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html)
    * Don't always need a function
