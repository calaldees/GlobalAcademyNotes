    * Modern OS's are too complex
    * Constantly writing state to system drives
    * Couple to physical drive
    * Multiboot a problem
    * Applications and OS mixed together
    * Applications as one folder
    * Mutiple versions of an application useable
    * No passwords by default
    * Offline by default
