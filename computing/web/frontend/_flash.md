    * > Because YOU didn't value something doesn't mean you understand all the ways it was valuable to others
    * > It's possible for technology to regress in big ways even as it moves forward in others
    * > The real reason Flash was inevitably going to die is that Adobe didn't create it with a business model that even let them cover costs on maintaining and improving it. Let alone turn a profit. So it had an installed base of two billion+, and yet they lost money on it every year.
