Consider ideas about industry software engineering.
Could be combined with the notes in my blog repo?

I was looking at case studies for [[telematry]] and was thinking of practical uses

* [Dev Concepts](https://dev-concepts.dev/) Book (pre-order)

* [What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/)
    * > "SV-like" companies think of engineers as value generators, and creative problem solvers. Traditional companies think of them as factory workers.
    1. Autonomy for software engineers
        * > The expectation from developers at traditional companies is to complete assigned work. At SV-like companies, it's to solve problems that the business has.
    2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources
        * > In practice, a motivated engineer easily makes multiple times the impact of a "factory worker" who is just told what to do
    3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency
    4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics
        * > In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business
    5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication
        * > Traditional companies will encourage hierarchical communication
    6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience
        * > While it might sound counter-intuitive to hire software engineers who only focus on other software engineers working faster: at many places, it's not. It's a great return that helps these companies move faster, and developers stay happier.
    7. Higher leverage --> higher {autonomy, pay}
