    * binary
    * oct
    * hex
    * 2s complement
    * Binary coded decimal, grey code
    * boolean algebra
    * gates and or not
    * xor nand nor
    * half adder
    * full adder, subtractor
    * multiplexor, demultiplexor
    * encoder
    * flip flop
* [Logic Design with MSI Circuits](https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~ademosth/E757/Topic1.pdf)
    * These are classified as standard components
    * adders, subtractors, comparators, decoders, encoders and multiplexers

* [Simple CPU design](http://www.simplecpudesign.com/)
    * > Computer architecture is awash with concepts that are fundamental to computer science generally and which do not appear in other parts of the undergraduate curriculum. A course in computer architecture can provide a suitable forum for incorporating fundamental principles in the CS curriculum
