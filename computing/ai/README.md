AI (Artificial Intelligence)
============================

* The elephant in the room in many education settings.
* Mass public misunderstanding
* TODO this section needs fleshing out MASSIVELY!

* [Coding Challenge #158: Shape Classifier Neural Network with ml5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqJzMvHE3E) - TODO WATCH!
    * He trains a network himself with drawing shapes and it recodnises shapes drawn on paper!
    * This could be an AMAZING activity
        * What about training the algorithm with lines - and then trying to regognise a filled circle. Could this be a powerful lesson in the data we tain algorithms with? (like the issues big tech companys had with recognising black faces with login systems)

* [What I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Tensor Computation Libraries](https://eigenfoo.xyz/tensor-computation-libraries/)

* [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver)
    * Explore the concepts and methods used in modern reinforcement learning research.
    * 10 part course
