One person on the planet solve the problem 'once' and it's solved forever

The pen is mightyer than the sword - a computer may be mightyer than the pen

If you could use a computer properly - if you could code, 
you could use it for incedible personal gain, maximise output, control infomation
or you could use it to empower people, grow comunitys and share the expanded capabilities with humanity
The choice is yours, but only if you know how to use the tool
Otherwise ... you don't get a choice, you'll be solving meaningless sodokus forever
