Online Etiquette
================

Chat
----

* [No Hello](https://nohello.net/)
    * please don't say just hello in chat
    * Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on hold...
* [If it will matter after today, stop talking about it in a chat room](https://critter.blog/2021/01/12/if-it-matters-after-today-stop-talking-about-it-in-a-chat-room/)
    * Chat is terrible for long form things that matter
