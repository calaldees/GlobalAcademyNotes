Hacking and Security
====================

You can't add it later

Question: how will you know you've had a data breach?

Users are evil and dumb
Could be hijacked
People are horrible

        * > Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: They can convey information about the software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive information about security-related computations.
        * > The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption ... using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.
