Documentation
=============

* [The grand unifying theory of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com)
    *  there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation, there are four.
        * tutorials - learning oriented
        * how-to guides - problem oriented
        * technical reference - information oriented
        * explanation - understanding oriented
