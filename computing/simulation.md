* [Modeling and Simulation in Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/) [pdf](http://greenteapress.com/modsimpy/ModSimPy3.pdf)
    * The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system and world population growth.
    * The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of infectious disease, thermal systems, and pharmacokinetics.
    * The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid bodies.
