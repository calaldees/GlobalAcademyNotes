```python
print('Hello World')
# yeah! comments and shit!
```

```python
def my_life_story():
    print('I was born on the moon')
    print('I like eating pizza')
    print('by the age of 12 I was 3 meaters tall')
    print('One day I will visit the sea')

my_life_story()
print('Hello World')
my_life_story()
```

(dynamic langauges - pyhton, php, javascript - just params)
(static langauges - c, java, vb - need to know type in advance)
```python
def my_life_story(name):
    print('my name is')
    print(name)
    print('I was born on the moon')
    print('I like eating pizza')
    print('by the age of 12 I was 3 meaters tall')
    print('One day I will visit the sea')
    print('so thats my story - from')
    print(name)

my_life_story('Bobbin')
```

paper
```python
x = 3
y = 1
z = x + y
print(z)
```


```python
answer = 12
print(answer)
```


```python
def add(a,b):
    return a + b


answer = add(5, 5)
print(answer)
```

```
a = 5
b = 2
answer = add(a, b)
print(answer)
```

implement multiply

```python
def multiply(a,b):
    ???

```

```python
print('give me two number to multiply together')
a = input('enter first item')
print('you gave me')
print(a)
b = input('enter second item')


answer = add(a, b)
print(answer)
```

(oh no! it string concatinates)
```python
a = int(a)
```

Modify to Add 3 numbers together


```python
operation = input('what operation do you want to perform (+ or *)')
if (operation == '+'):
    answer = add(a,b)
if (operation == '*'):
    answer = multiply(a,b)
```

implement subtract

try with divide - it breaks
try with pow - it breaks
answer = 'unknown'  or 0 in static lanaguage

```c
if () {}
else if () {}
else {}
```

try with '3.756'

a = float()
bool?
