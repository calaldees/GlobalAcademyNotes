Practical Programing
====================

Computer Science (vs, is different from) Software Engineering

Gymnastics/Training vs Engineering
Training in gym not running the marathon

Whole years projects in advance
To be complemented by _theory_ sessions and _engineering examples_

Setup
-----

Windows
```
    choco install vscode python3 java ojdkbuild visualstudio2019community
```
OSX
```
    brew install vscode python3 ?java?
```
Linux (Ubuntu example)

* position your windows so you can see terminal and code on screen at once
Play "Don't touch the mouse" - unplug it
* compile and run cycle
    * `python filename.py`
    * `javac *.java && java -cp ../ $(basename "$PWD").Session1`


Session1
--------

* function
    * params
* variables
    * type
* if

* Project
    * login
    * image size calculator

Session2
--------

May be worth repeating session1 with dynamic/static language

* project
    * 3rd language? Visual Basic?

Session3
--------

* arrays/lists
* loops
* files

* projects
    * trainings tasks +

Session4
--------

* dictionarys/maps/associative arrays
* data structures

* Version control
