Summary
-------


Tradition Learning: You work alone to produce your own work
Our approach:
* Collaboration is encouraged at all times (in person with multiple keyboards or vscode-live)
* Share all work as part of normal development (git)
* Build skills by:
    * Verbally describing your code to others
    * Reading more code (reading code is harder than writing code)
    * Get access to other ways of thinking about code
* Pair programming and code review are important professional skills


Traditional Learning: Start with one tool and focus on getting comfortable with single tool
Our approach:
* Learner uses a range of tools and are aware of the meta skills they are using/building


Traditional Learning: The teacher prescribes a series of sessions and directs the learning
Our approach:
* Learners given all tasks upfront
* Learners direct/guide/request teacher topics
* Learners responsible for their own learning
